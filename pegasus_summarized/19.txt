President of Ukraine Ukraine is one of the world's largest producers of coking coal, one of the world's largest producers of iron ore, one of the world's largest producers of uranium and one of the world's largest producers of rare earth elements. The Programme aims to meet the needs of the national economy in mineral resources, through its own extraction and production of minerals that are difficult high demand on the world market. The Programme of Action for the Development of Ukraine's Mineral Resource Base aims to develop Ukraine's mineral resource base as the material basis for the growth of the national economy. The main objectives of the Programme are as follows: The Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation has published a report on the initial hydrocarbon resources of the Eastern and Western regions. Ukraine's reserves of coal, oil and gas are estimated by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The Ministry of Energy and Coal Mining of Ukraine plans to carry out the following activities: Uranium ores This type of raw material belongs to Category B.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Mining and Geology has announced a series of measures aimed at increasing the country's mineral resources. Copper and cobalt Geological and economic assessment of promising copper deposits in the Volyn ore region and promising ore occurrences in Donetsk Basin in the south-western wing of Bakhmut Basin; targeted thematic and search studies on the development of forecast and search criteria for copper ore extraction associated with green-stone rock complexes (Dnipropetrovsk oblast). Nickel and copper This type of raw material belongs to Category D. Prospects for the extraction of lead and zinc from green-stone deposits in Ukraine are associated with gold and polymetallic deposits in Transcarpathia and Kharkiv oblasts.

Geological and economic assessment of promising geological formations of Ukraine for the presence of platinum group metals is caused by the constant expansion of the scope of their use. platinum group metals and diamonds The prospects for the discovery of diamond-bearing areas within the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the north-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Volyn-Padillia Plate, the south-western and central parts of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and the Pryazovia Plate, the south-western and Fluorspar, flux limestones and dolomites assessment of reserves and technological suitability for obtaining high-quality flux raw materials with chemical composition and mechanical strength as from Rodnykivka deposit and Balka Bezvodna section of Olenivka deposit for a converter and electric melting steel production. assessment of reserves and technological suitability for obtaining high-quality flux raw materials with chemical composition and mechanical strength as from Rodnykivka deposit and Balka Bezvodna section of Olenivka deposit for a converter and electric melting steel production. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Ukraine plans to carry out the following: Raw materials for mining, chemical and agro-industrial complexes Apatite Kola apatite This type of raw material belongs to Category D. Phosphorite and native sulfur Raw material reserves of the Carpathian Basin: Exploration and development of natural coloured stones, primary and flasks of porcelain and paper, and limestones for the sugar industry are under way in Ukraine. Limestone This type of raw material belongs to Category C. The Ukrainian Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has published a list of the most common raw materials used in different industries in Ukraine: feldspar, graphite, and man-made raw materials This type of raw material belongs to Category B. Geological mapping of the territory makes it possible to assess the prospects for developing the raw material base, combine the rational use of mineral resources with environmental safety, and create conditions for the state's sustainable development. Geological mapping of the territory makes it possible to assess the prospects for developing the raw material base, combine the rational use of mineral resources with environmental safety, and create conditions for the state's sustainable development. The State Geological Map of Ukraine on a scale of 1:2 (State Geological Map of Ukraine-200) was created in order to solve the following problems: Geological and engineering-geological mapping of the shelf of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is carried out in the following areas: It is necessary to carry out revaluation of forecast and prospective resources, as well as operational reserves of underground water for domestic drinking and technical water supply, medical, heat and power and industrial needs. Considering these problems of hydrogeological, engineering-geological and ecological-geological works, the following is planned: performing revaluation of forecast and prospective resources, as well as operational reserves of underground water for domestic drinking and technical water supply, medical, heat and power and industrial needs; conducting search and exploration of drinking, technical, mineral, heat and power and industrial underground waters to meet the needs of the national economy; continuation of annual drilling of artesian exploration and production wells (approximately 100) to provide the population with pollutant-free drinking water, primarily in regions affected by the consequences of a natural disaster, in the southern and eastern regions of the state, in regions with limited drinking water resources, as well as in territories with intense man-caused load; performing ecological and geological studies in territories with intensive technogenic load to determine factors and quantitative indicators of its impact on the geological environment with the development of measures to minimise such impact on living conditions within these territories; Geological and exploration work on the continental shelf and within the exclusive (marine) economic zone Geological, geophysical, and drilling operations carried out by many countries have shown that shelf zones and continental slopes are highly promising for many types of mineral raw materials, including oil and gas.
