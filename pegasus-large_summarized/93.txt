The intellectual property right to the dissemination of a plant variety is the right of its owner to disseminate the variety and to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the variety to other persons. The right to authorise or prohibit the dissemination consists in the fact that without the permission of the owner of the intellectual property right to dissemination the plant variety the following actions shall not be carried out in respect of the planting material of the variety: a) offer for sale; b) sale or other commercial turnover; g) storage for any of the purposes specified in clauses “a” to “b” of this part. Under the licence agreement, the patent owner (licenser) transfers the right to use the variety to another person (licensee), who undertakes to make payments to the licenser stipulated by the agreement and perform other actions provided by the licence agreement. 6.The grant of a licence for the use of a variety and the transfer of intellectual property rights to a plant variety shall be considered valid for third parties from the date when the relevant information is officially published, which is based on the relevant information in the Register of Patents. The term of validity of intellectual property rights to a plant variety shall begin on the day following the date of state registration of the right and shall end on the last day of the: a) thirty-fifth calendar year, calculated from 01 January of the year following the year of state registration of these rights, for varieties of trees and shrubs and grapes; b) the thirtieth calendar year, calculated from 01 January of the year following the year of state registration of these rights, for all other varieties. Fee for maintaining the validity of intellectual property rights to a plant variety and maintaining the validity of intellectual property rights to the dissemination of a plant variety shall be paid for each year starting from the calendar year following the year of state registration of rights. The fee for maintaining the validity of intellectual property rights for a plant variety or the validity of intellectual property rights for the dissemination of a plant variety in the first calendar year, following the year of state registration, shall also be paid during the first four months of this year. If the prescribed fee has not been paid within the specified twelve months, the information on termination of intellectual property rights to the plant variety or intellectual property rights to the dissemination of the plant variety shall be published in the official publication. If after three years from the date of state registration or the date when the use of a variety was terminated, a variety in Ukraine is not used or is used to an insignificant extent and if any person may refer to the owner of the variety with a proposal to conclude a licence agreement and the owner of the variety refuses to do so without a valid reason, that person may refer the matter to court and may claim the grant of a compulsory licence for use of the variety. Actions That Are Not Recognised as Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights to a Plant Variety The use of a variety without the consent (authorisation) of the patent owner shall not be recognised as an infringement of intellectual property rights to the plant variety in the cases when the following applies: a) exhaustion of the exclusive right of the patent owner; b) the right of prior use and the right to restore the rights to the variety; c) limitation of the validity of the exclusive right of the patent owner.
