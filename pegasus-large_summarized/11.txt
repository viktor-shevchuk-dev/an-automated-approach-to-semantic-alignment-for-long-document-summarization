Irrespective of the presence of motions, the court shall dispose the issue of expedience to extend the period of keeping the accused in custody until the expiry of the two-month period after the receipt by the court of the indictment, a motion to enforce compulsory medical or reformatory measures, or after the day of enforcing in respect of the accused of the measure of restraint in the form of keeping in custody. Upon the results of consideration of the issue, the court shall by its motivated ruling, repeal or change the measure of restraint in the form of keeping in custody, or extent its validity for a period that may not exceed two months. A court decision on choosing a measure of restraint in the form of detention, on changing another measure of restraint on a measure of restraint in the form of detention or on extending the term of detention, rendered during the court proceedings before the court of first instance, may be appealed. During court proceedings, the court upon a motion from the parties to the criminal proceedings or a victim in the presence of the grounds specified in Article 242 of this Code, shall have the right by its ruling to assign the conduct of the examination to an expert institution, an expert or experts. The court shall have the right by its ruling to assign the conduct of expert examination to an expert institution, an expert or experts irrespective of whether there is a motion on this, in the following cases: 1) if the court has been provided with a number of experts’ opinions contradicting each other, and the interrogation of experts has not removed the discovered contradictions; 2) if during the court proceedings, grounds came to light specified in part 2 of Article 509 of this Code. Where the court decides in court proceedings to grant access to objects and documents, the court shall postpone the trial for a time sufficient for conducting such measure of ensuring criminal proceedings and making its result known to the participants to the court proceedings. In its ruling to conduct investigative (detective) actions the court shall indicate the circumstances whose establishment or ascertainment necessitates the investigative (detective) actions as well as specify the investigative (detective) actions shall be conducted and determine the time for its assignment to be executed. In case where the accused has evaded from court or fallen ill with a mental or other grave prolonged disease that makes his participation in court proceedings impossible, the court shall suspend court proceedings in respect of this accused until his discovery or recovery, and shall continue court proceedings in respect of other accused persons, if it involves several persons. Court proceedings may be conducted through video conference with transmission from another premise, including such as is located beyond the bounds of the court premises, (remote court proceedings) where: 1) it is impossible for a participant of criminal proceedings to participate directly in the court proceedings for reason of health or for other valid reasons; 2) it is necessary to ensure safety of persons; 3) a minor or underage witness or victim is interviewed; 4) such measures are necessary to ensure prompt court proceedings; 5) there exist other grounds recognised sufficient by the court.

Remote court proceedings in accordance with the rules of this Article may be conducted in the courts of first, appellate and cassation instances during the court proceedings on any issues, the consideration of which is within the jurisdiction of the court. In view of delivering a just judicial decision and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, the court may go beyond the scope of charges brought in the indictment, only as regards changing legal qualification of the criminal offence concerned if such change alleviates the status of the person in respect of whom the criminal proceedings is conducted. In order to change legal qualification and/or the scope of charges, the public prosecutor shall have the right to change charges if the trial ascertained new factual circumstances of the criminal offence of which a person is accused. In the event of a change in the gravity of the crime from a grave or special grave crime to the crime provided for by part 2 of Article 314-1 of this Code, the court on its own initiative or at the request of persons provided for by part 5 of Article 314 hereof, shall decide to make a pre-trial report indicating the term of its preparation and adjourns the trial. If information is obtained that the accused has possibly committed another criminal offence in the respect of which charges were not brought and which is closely connected with the original one, where these may not be considered individually, as well as where grounds for applying criminal law measures to a legal entity have been established, the public prosecutor after fulfilling the requirements of Article 341 of this Code, shall have the right to lodge a motivated motion with court to consider an additional charge in the same proceedings with the original charge and/or initiate proceedings in respect of the legal entity. Whenever the court sustains such motion of the public prosecutor, the court is required to adjourn the trial for the time needed for the preparation of defence against a new charge or preparation of a representative of the legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken and for the public prosecutor to comply with provisions of Articles 276–278, 290–293 of this Code, but not more than for fourteen days.

If as a result of court proceedings, public prosecutor arrives at a conclusion that it is necessary to drop public prosecution, change charges, or bring additional charge, he shall be required to conciliate the appropriate procedural documents with the head of the public prosecutor’s office where he is employed. If the head of the public prosecutor’s office, the higher public prosecutor refuses to approve the indictment with the changed charge, a motion to bring additional charge, or a decision to drop public prosecution or initiate proceedings in respect of a legal entity, he shall remove from participation in trial the public prosecutor who raised the issue, and shall on his own participate in the trial as a public prosecutor, or assign such participation to another public prosecutor. After the actions specified in Articles 342 and 343 of this Code have been completed, presiding judge shall announce the composition of the court, name of the reserve judge, if such a judge is present, names of the public prosecutor, victim, civil plaintiff, the accused, defence counsel, civil defendant, representatives and legal representatives, interpreter, expert, specialist, court clerk, advise participants to the court proceedings of the right to disqualify, and find out whether they intend to disqualify anybody.

The right to deliver an introductory speech shall be given first to the prosecution, after which the speech shall be delivered by the defence. Where the court proceedings are held in relation to several defendants and if this serves the interests of criminal proceedings or the safety of the defendant, examination of one of the defendants may by a reasoned ruling of the court be carried out by video conference transmission from different premises under the rules of Article 336 of this Code. In addition, presiding judge shall find out whether the witness received the instructions about the rights and duties of a witness, and whether he understands them, and if necessary, explains them to him, as well as find out whether he does not refuse to give testimony on the grounds specified by this Code, and warns him about the criminal liability for refusal to give testimony and for knowingly giving misleading testimony. Whenever there are no obstacles to the examination of the witness, the judge presiding in the court session shall administer him/her the following oath: “I, (last name, first name, patronymic), take my oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.” A dumb witness shall take the oath in written form, signing the text of the same content. Upon the motion of a party to criminal proceedings or the witness himself, the witness concerned shall be examined in the absence of a certain already examined witness. In exceptional cases with a view to ensure security of a witness to be examined, the court, proprio motu or upon the motion of the parties to the criminal proceedings or of the witness himself/herself, passes a reasoned ruling to examine the witness concerned with the use of technical means from another premise, including outside court’s building, or in other way making his/her identification impossible, and ensures the parties to criminal proceedings the possibility to ask questions and hear answers thereto. Before such ruling is made the court shall establish whether the parties to the criminal proceedings have any objections to the examination of a witness in the conditions making his/her identification impossible and, where founded, decline to have the witness examined under the rules of this part. The witness may be examined repeatedly in the same or next court session upon his own initiative, upon a motion of a party to criminal proceedings or upon court’s initiative, particularly if, in the course of trial, it emerged that the witness can give testimonies regarding circumstances in respect of which he has not been examined. The court shall have the right to order simultaneous examination of two or more already examined participants to the criminal proceedings (witnesses, victims, the accused) to clarify reasons of differences in their testimonies, with such examination to be conducted with the account of rules laid down in part nine of Article 224 of this Code. Presiding judge shall advice the witness who has not attained the age of sixteen of the obligation to give true testimonies, without warning him/her about criminal liability for refusal to testify and for knowingly misleading testimonies, and shall not put him on oath. Before examination, presiding judge shall establish identity of the expert concerned and administer the following oath to him/her: “I, (last name, first name, patronymic), swear to faithfully fulfil expert’s duties using all my professional abilities.” Thereafter, presiding judge shall warn the expert about criminal liability for providing knowingly misleading findings. Expert who conducted expert examination upon request of the prosecution shall be first examined by the prosecution, while expert who conducted expert examination upon request of the defence, shall be first examined by the defence. After that the victim, civil plaintiff, civil defendant, their representatives and legal representatives, the representative of the legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken, as well as the presiding judge and other judges may pose their questions to the expert. 3.358 Expert may be asked questions regarding his/her possession of special knowledge and qualification in the field of examination (education, working experience, scientific degree etc.), relevant to the subject of his expert examination; methods used, and theoretical developments; sufficiency of information based on which findings were prepared; scientific basis and methods used to arrive at the conclusion; applicability and correctness of application of principles and methods to facts of the criminal proceedings; and other questions relating to the reliability of findings.

Where a document which has been attached to the records of criminal proceedings or produced to the court by a participant to criminal proceedings casts doubts with regard to its reliability, participants to court proceedings shall have the right to ask the court to exclude it from evidence and to dispose the case based on other evidence, or request that an expert examination be conducted of such document. Reproduction of audio recording and video replay shall be made in the courtroom or in any other specially equipped premise, with entering in journal of court session of main technical specifications of the equipment and media and the time when audio reproduction (video replay) was conducted. As an exception, having found it necessary to inspect a certain place, the court shall conduct on-site inspection as attended by participants in court proceedings and, when circumstances so require, with the participation of witnesses, specialists, and experts. On site, the participants to court proceedings attending such inspection may be asked questions related to the conduct of inspection. Where in the course of court proceedings, grounds are found for criminal proceedings to be held as to the application of compulsory medical measures, the court shall issue a ruling to change the procedure of court proceedings and continue trial in accordance with the rules set forth in Chapter 39 of this Code. After having ascertained circumstances established in the course of criminal proceedings and having verified them with evidence, judge presiding in the court session shall ask the participants to court proceedings whether they wish to submit supplementary arguments and what exactly.
