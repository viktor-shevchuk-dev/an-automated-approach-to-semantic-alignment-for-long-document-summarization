Relationships between specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management and local executive authorities and local governments Specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management shall ensure the implementation of measures aimed at improving the safety of personnel, the population, environmental protection at their subordinate facilities intended for radioactive waste management. To ensure constant updating and timely amendments to the State Register of Radioactive Waste and the State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories, regular state inventories of radioactive waste and radioactive waste repositories are carried out, including repositories for radioactive waste storage in the territory of producers of this waste. State Register of Radioactive Waste The creation of the State Register of Radioactive Waste and the organisation of its record-keeping is entrusted to the state administration body in the field of radioactive waste management. State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories The State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories must contain a systematised data bank of location, quantitative and qualitative characteristics, conditions of storage or disposal of radioactive waste, control and monitoring systems. Radiation safety of radioactive waste repositories in case of extreme natural phenomena (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, etc.), or emergency situations is ensured by scientifically substantiated design decisions on probable scenarios of events, which will prove that the limits established by norms, rules and standards of nuclear and radiation safety are not exceeded.

Shutting down (mothballing) of radioactive waste repositories Shutting down (mothballing) of radioactive waste repositories is carried out by the decision of the state administration body in the field of radioactive waste management, agreed with the body of state regulation of nuclear and radiation safety. After the decision to construct a radioactive waste repository or a facility intended for radioactive waste management, as well as the decision to start the design and survey works at the planned site is made, the specialised enterprise for radioactive waste management shall notify local executive authorities and local governments, on the territory of which the construction is planned.
