Within the coastal protective belt of the seas and around the sea bays and estuaries, a beach area shall be established, the width of which is determined depending on the landscape-forming activity of the sea, but not less than 100 metres from the water's edge, including: areas located between the line of maximum ebb and the line of maximum inflow of waves recorded during the strongest storms, as well as the area of the shore, which is periodically flooded by waves; Citizens shall be provided with unimpeded and free access to the coast of the seas, bays, estuaries and islands in inland waters within the beach area, to the banks of rivers, reservoirs and islands for general water use, except for protected areas, sanitary protection zones, control access zones and zones of special land use regime, as well as the land plots on which there are: hydraulic, hydrometric and linear structures; high-risk objects; boarding houses, objects of rehabilitation, sports, sanatoriums and other medical and health-improving establishments, children's health-improving camps which have the corresponding documents provided by the law on constructions and on the performance of the corresponding activity; objects of nature reserve fund, objects of cultural heritage. In coastal protective belts along seas, sea bays and estuaries and on islands in inland waters, the following shall be prohibited: 1) use of persistent and potent pesticides; 2) arrangement of landfills for household and industrial waste and waste water storage facilities; 3) installation of latrines for the accumulation of domestic waste water in excess of 1 cubic metre per day; 4) arrangement of filtration fields and creation of other facilities for the acceptance and disinfection of liquid waste; 5) burning of dry vegetation or its remnants in violation of the procedure established by the central executive authority in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection. The sizes of drainage diversion lanes and the mode of their use are established according to the project developed and approved by water users in coordination with oblast, Kyiv, Sevastopol city state administrations, executive authority of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea for environmental protection and the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management development. The boundaries of sanitary protection zones of water bodies are established by local councils on their territory in coordination with the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and the rational use of subsoil, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population, oblast, Kyiv, Sevastopol city state administrations, executive authority of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea for environmental protection. Water protection (water bodies protection) All waters (water bodies) are subject to protection from pollution, clogging, depletion and other actions that may worsen water supplies conditions, harm human health, cause the reduction in fish stocks and other water bodies, the aggravation of wildlife conditions, reduction of land fertility and other adverse phenomena due to changes in the physical and chemical properties of water, reducing their ability to natural purification, the breach of the hydrological and hydrogeological regime of water. Conditions for placement, design, construction, reconstruction and commissioning of enterprises, structures and other facilities that may adversely affect fishery water bodies Measures shall be taken to ensure the protection of fish, other aquatic animals and plants and their reproduction during the placement, design, construction, reconstruction and commissioning of enterprises, buildings and other facilities on fishery water bodies. Prohibition of commissioning of enterprises, buildings and other facilities that affect the state of water It is prohibited to put into operation: 1) new and reconstructed enterprises, shops, units, utilities and other facilities which are not equipped with devices and treatment facilities of the required capacity to prevent pollution and clogging of water or their harmful effects, and the necessary measuring equipment that records the volume of the fence and water discharge; 2) irrigation and watering systems, reservoirs and canals â€“ to carry out the measures provided by the projects to prevent flooding, inundation, natural pollution, salinisation of lands and soil erosion, as well as pollution of surface and groundwater by discharge from irrigation systems; 3) drainage systems â€“ to the full readiness of water intakes and other structures in accordance with the approved projects; 4) water intake structures â€“ without fish protection devices and water intake protection zones arranged in accordance with the approved projects; 5) hydraulic structures â€“ to the full readiness of devices for the passage of flood waters and fish in accordance with the approved projects; 6) production wells for water â€“ without equipping them with water-regulating and control-measuring devices. The protection of subsoil waters Enterprises, institutions and organisations whose actions may adversely affect the state of subsoil waters, especially those operating storage facilities for industrial, domestic and agricultural effluents or waste, shall take measures to prevent groundwater contamination, as well as equip local networks of observation wells to monitor the quality of these waters. In case of depletion of subsoil water reserves, as well as in case of subsoil water pollution, the reasons for it shall be established, and on the proposals of the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of environmental protection, rational use, reproduction and protection of natural resources, and the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, measures shall be taken to reproduce them at the expense of the perpetrators. Harmful effects of water and measures to prevent them and eliminate their consequences Harmful effects of water are: 1) the consequences of floods that have led to flooding and inundation of lands and settlements; 2) destruction of shores, protective dams and other structures; 3) waterlogging, flooding and salinisation of lands caused by rising subsoil water levels due to unregulated water supply during irrigation, water leakage from water supply and sewerage systems and blockage of subsoil water flows during the placement of large industrial and other structures; 4) land drainage caused by subsoil water abstraction in excess of the established volumes of water abstraction; 5) contamination (salinisation) of lands in areas of mining, as well as after the end of operation of deposits and their conservation; 6) soil erosion, the In emergency situations on water bodies related to their pollution, which may adversely affect human health and the state of aquatic ecosystems, the enterprise, institution or organisation that have caused the accident or that detected it must immediately start liquidating its consequences and report the accident to the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population, oblast, Kyiv, Sevastopol city state administrations, the executive authority of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on environmental protection and the relevant council. The procedure for consideration of disputes concerning the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources Disputes over the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources shall be considered by the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of environmental protection, rational use, reproduction and protection of natural resources, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management development, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, local councils, court or arbitration court in the manner prescribed by law. Plaintiffs â€“ the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of environmental protection, rational use, reproduction and protection of natural resources, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management shall be released from the payment of state duties in the cases regarding the recovery of damages caused by violations of water legislation. Responsibility for the water law violation shall be borne by persons guilty of: 1) unauthorised occupation of water bodies; 2) pollution and clogging of waters; 3) violation of the economic activity regime in water protection zones and on the lands of the water fund; 4) destruction of riverbeds, streams and watercourses or violation of natural conditions of surface runoff during the construction and operation of roads, railways and other utilities; 5) commissioning of enterprises, utilities and other facilities without treatment facilities or devices of adequate capacity; 6) non-compliance with the terms of the permit or violation of the rules for special water use; 7) unauthorised hydraulic works (construction of ponds, dams, canals, wells); 8) violation of the rules of state accounting of waters or distortion or introduction of unreliable information in the documents of state statistical reporting; 8-1) burning dry vegetation or its remains in violation of the procedure established by the central executive authority in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection, in coastal protection zones and on islands; 9) damage to water management and hydrometric structures and devices, violation of operating rules and established modes of their operation; 10) illegal creation of return water discharge systems into water bodies, city sewerage network or drainage sewerage and unauthorised return water discharge; 11) misuse Application of international treaties If an international treaty in which Ukraine participates establishes norms other than those stipulated by the water legislation of Ukraine, the norms of the international treaty shall apply.
