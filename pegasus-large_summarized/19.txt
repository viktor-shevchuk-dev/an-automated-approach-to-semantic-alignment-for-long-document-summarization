3268-VI of 21 April 2011 NATIONWIDE PROGRAMME FOR MINERAL RESOURCES BASE DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE FOR THE PERIOD UNTIL 2030 Section I GENERAL PART The proper provision of the economy's needs for mineral resources and their effective use is one of the most significant factors in overcoming the crisis in the Ukrainian economy. Almost 20 thousand deposits and presence of 117 types of mineral resources are present in the bowels of our country, of which 8,290 deposits and 1,110 accounting objects for 98 types of mineral raw materials have industrial importance and are accounted for in the state balance of mineral reserves, 3,349 deposits are being developed. Over the past 5–10 years, real opportunities for further growth of hydrocarbon reserves, discovery and exploration of deposits of new types of minerals for Ukraine, namely gold, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, rare and rare-earth elements, lithium, niobium, tantalum, phosphorites, fluorite, stone-coloured raw materials, etc., have been confirmed. Therefore, these countries continue to increase investment in geological exploration in their territories and those of developing countries; The analysis of global trends over the past 10–15 years shows the highest rates in production and consumption of energy resources, alloying metals and certain types of non-ferrous and rare metals, precious metals and diamonds, raw materials for agriculture. According to industrial and economic significance, it is planned to divide raw materials as a component of the mineral resource base of Ukraine into the following categories: Category A includes mineral raw materials that are intensively extracted in Ukraine, characterised by significant proven reserves of minerals and components and are the subject of the export or can be considered as such to provide foreign exchange earnings and revenues to the state budget in a short time; Category B includes mineral raw materials that are currently produced in Ukraine in limited volumes, the cost of production of which provides the maximum economically profitable level of profitability, development, and the proven reserves of deposits are small or depleted, and new deposits are not sufficiently studied; still, the need for such raw materials is due to the development of the industry. concentration of efforts, including financial resources, on priority areas of development of the mineral resource base, search and exploration of mineral deposits, primarily strategically crucial for the national economy; activation of work on the geological study of subsurface resources using modern means of accumulation, systematisation and processing of geological information, the introduction of new methods and technologies for prospecting and exploration of mineral deposits; differential approach to the assessment of reserves and prospective resources of mineral raw materials, the introduction of rational methods for developing complex deposits and extracting related components, reproduction of the resource potential of regions with intensive extraction of mineral resources; activation of international co-operation on geological exploration, rational use and protection of mineral resources.

In Ukraine, deposits of quartz-glauconite sands of Neogene and Cretaceous age are widely distributed on the territory of the Volyn-Podillia Plate, the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and in the south-eastern part of the Dnipro-Donets Rift. The presence of its own raw material base of barium sulphate ores has become particularly relevant in recent years due to the depletion of reserves of these ores in the deposits of Russia, from where Ukraine imported raw materials. In this direction, the following is planned: conducting a searching assessment of deposits that are promising for ensuring an increase in reserves of high-strength categories of crushed stone and rubble within the western and central regions of Ukraine; preparation for the industrial development of promising areas of reserve deposits promising to ensure an increase in reserves of high-strength categories of crushed stone and rubble.
