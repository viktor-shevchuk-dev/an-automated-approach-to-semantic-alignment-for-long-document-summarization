LAW OF UKRAINE This Law is based on the recognition of the value of arbitration (arbitration tribunal) as a widely used method of settling disputes arising in international trade and the need for comprehensive regulation of international commercial arbitration by means of legislation; it takes into account the provisions on such arbitration contained in the international treaties of Ukraine as well as in the model law adopted in 1985 by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and approved by the UN General Assembly for its possible use by the states in their legislation. By agreement of the parties, the following may be submitted to international commercial arbitration: disputes resulting from contractual and other civil law arising in the course of foreign trade and other forms of international economic relations provided that the place of business of at least one of the parties is located abroad; as well as disputes between enterprises with foreign investment and international associations and organisations established within the territory of Ukraine, between themselves, disputes between their participants as well as their disputes with other subjects of Ukrainian law. Relationships of commercial nature include, but are not limited to, the following agreements: any trade agreements on the delivery of goods or output of services, or the exchange of goods and services; distribution contracts, trade representative; factoring; leasing; engineering; construction of industrial works; consulting; licensing agreements; investment; provision of finance; banking services; insurance; operating or concession agreements; joint ventures and other forms of industrial or business cooperation; and transportation of goods and conveyance of passengers by air, sea, rail and road; - where a provision of this Law, except Article 28, leaves the parties free to make a decision on a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorise a third party, including an institution, to make such a decision; - where a provision of this Law refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refers to an agreement of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration rules referred to in that agreement; - where a provision of this Law, other than paragraph 1 of Article 25 and clause 2 of Article 32, refers to a claim, it also applies to a counter-claim, and where it refers to a defence, it also applies to a defence to such counter-claim. The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such to make that clause part of the contract. A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if any party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute, leave the claim without consideration and refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. Arbitration agreement and interim measures by the court It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitration proceedings, a court to order an interim measure of protection and for a court to rule on granting such measure. In the absence of such agreement, - in an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within thirty days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of any party, by the court or other authority specified in clause 1 of Article 6; - in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator, he or she shall be appointed, upon request of any party, by the authority specified in clause 1 of Article 6. Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties, - a party fails to act as required under such procedure, or - the parties, or two arbitrators, are unable to reach an expected agreement of them under such procedure, or - a third party, including an institution, Failing such agreement, a party which intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitration tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstance referred to in clause 2 of Article 12, send a written statement of the reasons for challenging to the arbitration tribunal. If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure of clause 2 of this Article is not successful, the challenging party may request, within 30 days after receiving notification of the decision rejecting the challenge, the authority specified in clause 1 of Article 6 to decide on the challenge; such a decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitration tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitration proceedings and make an arbitration award. If under this Article or clause 2 of Article 13, an arbitrator withdraws from office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply the recognition of any ground referred to in this Article or clause 2 of Article 12. Appointment of a substitute arbitrator Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under Article 13 or 14 or because of his or her withdrawal from office for any other reason or because of the revocation of his or her mandate by agreement of the parties or in any other case of termination of the arbitrator's mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that applied to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. If the arbitration tribunal rules as a preliminary issue that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within 30 days after having received notification of that ruling, the authority specified in Article 6 to decide the matter; such a decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitration tribunal may continue the arbitration proceedings and make an arbitration award. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration tribunal may, at the request of any party, order any party to take such interim measures of protection as the arbitration tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject matter of the dispute. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 1 of this Article, the arbitration tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any venue it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of goods, other property or documents. Commencement of arbitration proceedings Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the defendant. Within the period of time agreed by the parties or determined by the arbitration tribunal, the plaintiff shall state the facts supporting its claim, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the defendant shall state his defence in respect of these particulars unless the parties have otherwise agreed as to the required elements of such statements. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement its claim or defence during the course of the arbitration proceedings, unless the arbitration tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it. Failure to submit documents or appear at a hearing Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if, without showing a sufficient cause: 1) the plaintiff fails to communicate its statement of claim under clause 1 of Article 23, the arbitration tribunal shall terminate the proceedings; 2) the defendant fails to communicate its statement of defence under clause 1 of Article 23, the arbitration tribunal shall continue the proceedings without treating such failure in itself as an admission of the plaintiff's allegations; 3) any party fails to appear at a hearing or to produce documentary evidence, the arbitration tribunal may continue the proceedings and make the award on the basis of evidence in the case; 4) any party fails to submit evidence at the request of the arbitration tribunal, the arbitration tribunal, depending on which person avoids its submission, as well as of what importance this evidence is, may recognise the circumstance for clarification whereof the evidence was to be submitted or refuse to recognise it or consider the case based on the evidence before it. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration tribunal may: a) appoint one or more experts to report to it on specific issues to be determined by the arbitration tribunal; b) require a party to give the expert any information relevant to the case or to produce, or to provide access to, any relevant documents, goods or other property for inspection. Decision-making by a panel of arbitrators In arbitration proceedings with a panel of arbitrators, any decision of the arbitration tribunal shall be made, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, by a majority of all its members. If during arbitration proceedings, the parties settle the dispute, the arbitration tribunal shall terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the parties and not objected to by the arbitration tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitration award on agreed terms. The arbitration tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitration proceedings when: - the plaintiff withdraws its claim unless the defendant objects thereto and the arbitration tribunal recognises a legitimate interest on his part in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute; - the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings; Within 30 days of receipt of the award, unless another period has been agreed upon by the parties: - any party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitration tribunal to correct in the award any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error or any errors of similar nature; - if so agreed by the parties, any party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitration tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific clause or part of the arbitration award. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within 30 days of receipt of the arbitration award, the arbitration tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitration proceedings but omitted from the award. An arbitration award may be set aside by the court specified in paragraph 2 of Article 6 only if: 1) the party making the application for setting aside furnishes proof that: a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in Article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of Ukraine; or it was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present its case; or the award was made regarding a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the arbitration agreement, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, however, if the decisions on matters covered by the arbitration agreement can be separated from those not covered by such agreement, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters not covered by such agreement may be set aside; or the composition of the arbitration tribunal or the arbitration procedure did not comply with the agreement of the parties unless such agreement was in conflict with any provision of this Law from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, did not comply with this Law; or 2) the court finds that: the subject matter of the dispute cannot be the object of the arbitration proceedings under the law Ukraine; or the arbitration award is contrary to the public policy of Ukraine. The court, when asked to set aside an arbitration award, may, where appropriate and so requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time determined by it to allow the arbitration tribunal to resume the arbitration proceedings or take such other action as in the arbitration tribunal’ 1) at the request of the party against which it is invoked, if that party furnishes to the competent court where recognition or enforcement is sought proof that: - the party to the arbitration agreement referred to in Article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or - the party against which the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present its case; or - the award was made regarding a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the arbitration agreement, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, however, if the decisions on matters covered by the arbitration agreement can be separated from those not covered by such agreement, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters covered by such agreement may be recognised and enforced; or - the composition of the arbitration tribunal or the arbitration procedure did not comply with the agreement of the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, did not comply with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or - the award has not yet become binding By agreement of the parties, the following may be referred to the International Commercial Arbitration Court: - disputes resulting from contractual and other civil law relationships arising in the course of foreign trade and other forms of international economic relations, provided that the place of business of at least one of the parties is located abroad; as well as - disputes of enterprises with foreign investment, international associations and organisations established on the territory of Ukraine, between themselves, disputes between their participants as well as their disputes with other subjects of the law of Ukraine.
