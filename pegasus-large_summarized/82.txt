However, if the insurer knew or should have known when entering into the marine insurance contract that the possibility of an insured event had passed or the policyholder knew or should have known of a loss that had already occurred and was to be indemnified by the insurer, performance of the insurance contract shall not be binding on the party who was not aware of these circumstances. Duties of the policyholder under the general policy The policyholder shall, for each shipment of cargo covered by the general policy, provide the insurer with all necessary information immediately upon receipt, in particular the name of the vessel on which the cargo is carried, the route of the cargo and the insured amount.

However, the expenses referred to in Article 266 of this Code as well as the general average contributions shall be reimbursed by the insurer regardless of the fact that they together with the loss reimbursement may exceed the insured amount. Subrogation In the event of payment of the insured amount, except in the case provided for in Article 266 of this Code, the following shall be transferred to the insurer with its consent: 1) all rights to the insured property – in the case of full value insurance; 2) the right to a share of the insured property pro rata to the ratio of the insured amount to the insured value – in the case of partial insurance.

Insurer’s right in respect of third parties The insurer who has paid the insurance indemnity shall acquire, up to the amount paid, the right of claim which the policyholder (or any other person who has received the insurance indemnity) has against the person liable for the damage caused. If the policyholder has waived their right of claim against the person responsible for the damage caused or if the exercise of this right has become impossible through their fault, the insurer shall be exempted from payment of the insurance indemnity in whole or in part.

Determining the value of sacrificed cargo Losses from damage to or loss of sacrificed cargo to indemnified by way of adjustment of the general average shall be determined according to the value at the time of unloading, which shall be based on the invoice issued to the consignee, or if there is no invoice, on the shipment value thereof. Determination of the total value of property Contributions relating to the general average shall be deducted from the actual net value of the property at the time of voyage completion, except for contributions for cargo that are deducted from the value of the cargo at the time of unloading, as determined from the invoice issued to the consignee or, in the absence of invoice, from the value of the shipment.

When a lawsuit for compensation for nuclear damage is brought against the operator of a nuclear vessel, the insurer or another person who has provided financial security to the operator shall have the right to take part in the proceedings. Where the amount of nuclear damage caused exceeds the limit of liability of the nuclear vessel operator set out in part 1 of Article 318 of this Code, at the request of the nuclear vessel operator, the plaintiff or the authority that authorised to operate the nuclear vessel, a fund shall be established in court proceedings to secure limited liability in the amount of that limit by means of depositing money (deposit) by the operator or other security that is deemed admissible and sufficient by the court. Scope of the rules concerning the remuneration for salvage at sea The rules of this chapter shall apply in the event of salvage of seagoing vessels in danger and also in the event of salvage by seagoing vessels of inland navigation vessels or any other floating objects or towed objects, regardless of the waters in which the salvage took place, in the case where the dispute over the salvage is being adjudicated in Ukraine. A salvor of people who has participated in rendering the services in connection with an accident that necessitated the salvage shall be entitled to an equitable share in the amount due to the salvor for salvaging the vessel or other property or preventing or reducing damage to the environment.
