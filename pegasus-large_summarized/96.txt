The recusal shall be motivated and declared within ten days from the date of receipt by a case party of a resolution on commencement of proceedings, but not later on than the beginning of a preparatory hearing or the first court hearing, if a case is considered in accordance with the simplified action proceedings. If the court concludes that the recusal is unjustified and the application for such recusal was received by the court three working days (or earlier) before the next session, the issue on recusal shall be resolved by a judge who is not a member of the court that considers a case, and is defined in the manner prescribed by Part 1, Article 32 of this Code.

The court of first instance has the right to involve a co-defendant at the request of a plaintiff until the end of the preliminary proceedings, and before the first court hearing if a case is considered under the rules of the simplified action proceedings.

After the expiration of a period specified in Parts 1 and 2 of this Article, the court may involve a co-defendant in a case or replace the original defendant with the appropriate defendant only if a plaintiff proves that they did not know and could not know before filing a claim the basis for the involvement of such a co-defendant or the replacement of an improper defendant. Third parties declaring independent claims on the subject of a dispute may intervene in a case before the end of the preparatory proceedings or before the first court hearing if a case is considered in the simplified action proceedings by filing a claim against one or more parties. Third parties who do not declare independent claims on the subject of a dispute may intervene in a case on the part of a plaintiff or a defendant before the end of the preliminary proceedings or before the first court hearing if a case is considered in the simplified action proceedings, if the court ruling may affect their rights or obligations towards one of the parties. If the court when resolving an issue on the commencement of proceedings or when preparing a case for consideration establishes that a ruling of the commercial court may affect the rights and obligations of the persons who are not trial participants, the court shall involve such persons in a case as third parties who do not declare independent claims on the subject of a dispute. If a case is considered without notification of a third party on the consideration of a case, the circumstances of a case established by a court ruling have no legal consequences when considering a claim filed by a party involved in this case, against this third party, or a claim declared by that third party to such a party. In cases established by law, state authorities, local governments, individuals and legal entities may apply to the court on behalf of others, in the state or public interests and participate in these cases.

Refusal of a body authorised to exercise the relevant functions in the disputed legal relationship from a claim (application) filed by a prosecutor on behalf of the state, submission of an application to leave a claim without consideration shall not deprive a prosecutor of the right to support a claim (application) and demand consideration of a case on the merits.
