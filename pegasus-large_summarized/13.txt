For the purposes of this Code, parties shall be deemed to be related to each other in the cases specified in Article 15 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 . When selling goods between related parties, the value of the transaction is used as a basis for determining the customs value of the goods being valued under the first method, if the declarant shows that such value is close to the value of one of the following transactions which took place simultaneously or almost simultaneously with the transaction involving goods being valued: 1) transaction value when selling to unrelated buyers identical or similar goods for export to Ukraine; 2) the customs value of identical or similar goods, determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 62 of this Code; 3) the customs value of identical or similar goods, determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 63 of this Code.

If, for the purposes of applying this method, more than one contract value is identified for similar goods, the lowest value shall be used to determine the customs value of the goods being valued. Goods that are not manufactured by the producer of the goods being valued, but by another person, shall be taken into account only if there are neither identical, nor similar goods manufactured by the producer of the goods being valued. If the goods being valued or identical or similar imported goods are sold (alienated) in the customs territory of Ukraine in the same condition, to determine the customs value of goods using this method the basis shall be the unit price at which the goods being valued or identical or similar imported goods are sold on the territory of Ukraine in the largest total quantities to the buyer, who is not related to the seller, at the same time or at a time close to the date of import of the goods being valued, subject to subtraction, if possible to separate, of the following components: 1) payment of commissions, which are usually paid or payable, or ordinary trade surcharges to make a profit and covering general expenses in connection with the sale in the customs territory of Ukraine of goods of the same class and type.

If there are no cases of sale of the goods being valued, identical or similar goods in the same condition in which they were on the day of importation into Ukraine, at the request of the declarant or its authorised representative, the customs value of such goods shall be determined on the basis of unit price at which such goods are sold in Ukraine after further processing in the largest quantity to persons not related to the persons from whom they purchase such goods. Such information shall be based on the manufacturer's commercial accounts, provided that such accounts are compatible with the generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the country where the goods are manufactured; 2) the amount of profit and general expenses equal to the amount that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or type as the goods being valued, which are produced by producers in the country of export for export to Ukraine; 3) total costs of selling to Ukraine from the country of export of goods of the same class or type, i.e. The customs value of imported goods shall not be determined in accordance with provisions of this Article on the basis of: 1) prices of goods of Ukrainian origin on the domestic market of Ukraine; 2) a system that provides for the adoption for customs purposes of the higher of the two alternative values; 3) prices of goods on the domestic market of the exporting country; The customs value of goods imported into Ukraine in accordance with customs regimes other than the import regime shall be the price of the goods indicated in the invoice or proforma invoice.
