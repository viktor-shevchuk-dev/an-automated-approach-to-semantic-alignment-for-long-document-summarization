LAW OF UKRAINE This Law is based on the recognition of the value of arbitration (arbitration tribunal) as a widely used method of settling disputes arising in international trade and the need for comprehensive regulation of international commercial arbitration by means of legislation; it takes into account the provisions on such arbitration contained in the international treaties of Ukraine as well as in the model law adopted in 1985 by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and approved by the UN General Assembly for its possible use by the states in their legislation. The functions referred to in clauses 3 and 4 of Article 11, clause 3 of Article 13, Article 14 are performed by the President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine. Within the period of time agreed by the parties or determined by the arbitration tribunal, the plaintiff shall state the facts supporting its claim, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the defendant shall state his defence in respect of these particulars unless the parties have otherwise agreed as to the required elements of such statements. The court may execute this request within its competence and according to its rules on taking evidence. PART VI ADJUDGEMENT OF ARBITRATION AWARD AND TERMINATION OF PROCEEDINGS Article 28. An arbitration award on agreed terms shall be made under the provisions of Article 31 and shall state that it is an arbitration award. Article 33.
