The Fund's money is allocated for the implementation of budget programmes, which involve works and measures to design, build, commission, operate, decommission or shut down the facilities intended for radioactive waste management, which have been transferred by licensees to state property. The central government executive authority in the field of radioactive waste management is entrusted with the following functions: Development and implementation of a uniform technical policy in the field of radioactive waste management in Ukraine; Implementation of the National Targeted Environmental Programme for Radioactive Waste Management; Co-ordination of works on the collection, processing, transportation, storage and disposal of radioactive waste of industry, nuclear energy, medicine, research institutions and radioactive waste generated during the liquidation of the Chornobyl disaster; Organisation of the activity of specialised enterprises on radioactive waste management; Creation and ensuring the functioning of the state record-keeping system of radioactive waste; Co-ordination of works on construction, operation, reconstruction, decommissioning of facilities intended for radioactive waste management, and shutting down storage sites for disposal; Co-ordination of works on creation of new repositories of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; Co-ordination of research and development work in the field of radioactive waste management; Development of the procedure for creation and use of the money of the State Fund for Radioactive Waste Management; Organising the activities to determine, create and maintain continuous operation of the radioactive waste physical protection system, as well as control over its support during the collection, processing, transportation, storage and disposal. Relationships between specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management and local executive authorities and local governments Specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management shall ensure the implementation of measures aimed at improving the safety of personnel, the population, environmental protection at their subordinate facilities intended for radioactive waste management. Ensuring physical protection during radioactive waste management Ensuring physical protection during radioactive waste management provides a unified system of planning, coordination and control over a set of organisational and technical measures aimed at preventing unauthorised entry into repositories, access to radioactive waste and its use, timely detection and suppression of any encroachments on integrity and inviolability of the structures. The procedure for organising physical protection during radioactive waste management is determined by law. Operation of radioactive waste repositories is carried out in accordance with the norms, rules and standards on nuclear and radiation safety with the provision of radiation monitoring of the condition of radioactive waste repositories. The special regime on the territory of radioactive waste repositories in the sanitary protection zone after their shut-down is regulated by law.
