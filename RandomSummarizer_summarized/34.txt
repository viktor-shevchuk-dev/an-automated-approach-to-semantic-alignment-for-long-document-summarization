Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: released energy – electric or heating energy supplied to consumers from a co-generation unit; additional fuel – fuel that is burned permanently or temporarily in the combustion products of the main fuel to increase the electric and/or heating capacity of the co-generation unit; efficiency of using additional fuel – the ratio of the increase in the amount of released energy (electrical and/or heat energy) supplied by the co-generation unit during the year, due to the combustion of additional fuel during the specified period, to the energy of such additional fuel; qualification of a co-generation unit – determination by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving that the conditions and indicators of the co-generation unit operation meet the requirements (qualification indicators) of this Law; qualified co-generation unit – a co-generation unit, the conditions and performance of which meet the requirements of this Law; co-generation unit – a set of equipment that works by the method of combined production of electric and heating energy or converts the discharge energy potential of technological processes into electric and heating energy; combined production of electric and heating energy (co-generation) – a method of simultaneous production of electric and heating energy within one technological process as a result of fuel combustion; main fuel – fuel that ensures the efficiency of the co-generation unit, including the discharge energy potential of technological processes; the discharge energy potential of technological processes – secondary energy resources that can be used to produce electric and heating energy in co-generation units. The exploitation of co-generation units is carried out under the following conditions: maintaining the necessary balance of capacity and quality of electricity generated by co-generation units to ensure the reliable operation of the energy system; preventing unauthorised intervention in the operation of the emergency automation system. Principles of the public policy on the use of co-generation units The public policy on the use of co-generation units is based on the principles of: development and balanced use of co-generation units in the national economy; facilitating the restructuring of existing heat generation facilities into combined electric and heating energy units to increase fuel efficiency and environmental safety; creating distributed (local) electricity generation capacity as a condition for improving the reliability and safety of energy supply at the regional level; government regulation of relations in this area; economic incentives for the use of co-generation units in enterprises, irrespective of their form of ownership or sectoral affiliation; ensuring free access of government regulatory authorities to information on the condition of co-generation units and volumes of electric and heating energy production. Authorised persons of the owner (co-owner), investor of the co-generation unit are granted the right to access the territory, premises and equipment of energy facilities for the construction and maintenance of the co-generation unit under the conditions specified in the investment agreement. The owners (co-owners) and investors of the co-generation unit are granted under the Land Code of Ukraine, the right to use the land where the co-generation unit is located, including the protection zone with restrictions (encumbrances) under the law or an agreement. The qualification period is one year. The owner of the heat grid is obliged to connect the co-generation unit to its heat grid in the manner prescribed by the regulations, subject to the fulfilment of the connection contract and after the approval of the technical commission act on the readiness of the co-generation unit to be accepted for operation.
