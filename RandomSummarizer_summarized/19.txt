Almost 20 thousand deposits and presence of 117 types of mineral resources are present in the bowels of our country, of which 8,290 deposits and 1,110 accounting objects for 98 types of mineral raw materials have industrial importance and are accounted for in the state balance of mineral reserves, 3,349 deposits are being developed. Within the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, two large rare metal distribution areas of tantalum and niobium are distinguished: the Pryazovia and North-Western regions. Large Mazurivka deposit, located in Donetsk oblast near Donetsk Chemical and Metallurgical Plant is the most thoroughly studied deposit. The only field in the country is Stylsko (the Donets Basin) deposit, closed due to hydrogeological problems. The State Service of Geology and Mineral Resources of Ukraine will carry out activities within the framework of the Intergovernmental Council of the CIS countries to solve the problems of mineral resources use of the CIS countries and develop priority measures for co-ordination and development of co-operation in the field of study, exploration and use of mineral resources.
