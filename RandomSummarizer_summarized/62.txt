Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: alternative types of fuel – solid, liquid and gas fuel which is an alternative to relevant traditional types of fuel and is produced (extracted) from non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials; wastes – slags and wastes from industry, agriculture, municipal and other enterprises that may be a source or raw material for the extraction or production of alternative types of fuel; non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials – raw materials of plant origin, wastes, solid fuels, other natural and artificial sources and types of energy raw materials including oil, gas, gas condensate and oil and gas condensate depleted, non-industrial and technogenic deposits, heavy grades of oil, natural bitumen, gas-saturated water, gas hydrates, etc., the production (extraction) and processing of which requires the use of new technologies and which are not used for production (extraction) of traditional types of fuel; consumers of alternative types of fuel – individuals and legal entities that use technical equipment, including internal combustion engines, boiler units, furnaces, other power generating units, systems and machines, that fully or partially operate on alternative types of fuel; field of alternative types of fuel – the field of activity related to the production (extraction), transportation, storage and consumption of alternative types of fuel; biological types of fuel (biofuel) – solid, liquid and gas fuel produced from biologically renewable raw materials (biomass) that may be used as fuel or a component of other types of fuel; biocomponent – biofuel used as a component of other types of fuel; biomass – a non-fossil biologically active renewable substance of organic origin, capable of biodegradation, in the form of products, wastes and residues of forestry and agriculture (crop production and livestock) fishery and industries technologically related to them as well as bidegradable component of industrial and domestic wastes; bioethanol – dehydrated ethyl alcohol made from biomass or raw ethyl alcohol to be used as biofuel; biobutanol – butil alcohol made from biomass used as biofuel or biocomponent; biodiesel fuel (biodiesel) – methyl and/or ethyl esters of higher organic acids obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats that are used as biofuel or biocomponent; biogas – gas obtained from biomass that is used as fuel; biohydrogen – hydrogen obtained from biomass; it is a type of biogas; biofuel producer – a business entity that directly produces biofuel from biomass; additives based on bioethanol – biocomponents of motor fuel obtained by means of synthesis using bioethanol or by mixing bioethanol with organic compounds and fuel obtained from raw hydrocarbons, the content of bioethanol in which fulfils the requirements of regulatory acts and which are categorised as biofuel; liquid fuel from biomass – diesel biofuel, bioethanol, biobutanol, pure oil and other synthetic fuels, made from biomass; synthetic biofuels – synthetic hydrocarbons and mixtures of synthetic hydrocarbons made from biomass. Procedure for determining fuel as alternative Belonging of fuel to alternative type of fuel shall be confirmed by a fuel identification document issued by the authorised executive authority following the procedure established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Biological types of fuel intended for sale as commercial products shall be subject to mandatory certification in accordance with the legislation. Article 8. The production and storage of ethyl alcohol at enterprises producing bioethanol shall be prohibited. If an international treaty of Ukraine ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine provides for other rules than those contained in this Law, the rules of the international treaty of Ukraine shall apply. Within six months from the day of enactment of this Law, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine shall: prepare and submit for consideration to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine the proposals on bringing the laws of Ukraine in line with the Law of Ukraine “On Alternative Types of Liquid and Gas Fuel”; bring its regulatory acts in line with this Law; subject to its competence, ensure adoption of the regulatory acts provided for in this Law; ensure that ministries and other central executive authorities review and cancel their regulatory acts contrary to this Law.
