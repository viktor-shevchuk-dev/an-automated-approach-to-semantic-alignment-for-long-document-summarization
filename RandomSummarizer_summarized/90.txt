The Attestation Commission shall consist of NIPO’s employees, the central executive authority in charge of shaping and implementing state policy in the field of intellectual property, and representatives in cases of intellectual property (patent attorneys) who have at least 10 years of practical experience in the field of legal protection of intellectual property. The certificate shall be earlier terminated under the conditions established in Article 18 of this Law. Signs that contradict the requirements of part 2, Article 5 of this Law and the Law of Ukraine “On Condemnation of the Communist and National-Socialist (Nazi) Totalitarian Regimes in Ukraine and Prohibition of Propaganda of Their Symbols” shall not be granted legal protection and shall not be registered as trademarks. For the holder of the international registration, such term shall be two months from the date of sending the request to refuse granting legal protection to the trademark under the international registration in Ukraine for all specified goods and services or grant legal protection to the trademark for some of specified goods and services to the International Bureau of WIPO by NIPO. The priority date of the divisional application shall be determined the same as the priority date of the divided application, if there is a ground for that. If a certificate was invalidated and the court established that the application had been submitted with violation of other person's rights, the court may decide on the compensation of losses by the certificate holder in favour of the person that suffered losses caused by the actions resulting from the registration of the trademark with violation of that person’s rights. The decision of the Appeals Chamber on the recognition of a trademark to be well known in Ukraine may be appealed in court.
