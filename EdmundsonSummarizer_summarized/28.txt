Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: 1) high technologies – technologies developed on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge which, being at a higher technological level, outperform the best domestic and foreign analogues and are competitive in the world market of high-tech products; 2) technology transfer agreement – an agreement concluded in writing between holders of property rights to the technology or its components and/or the persons they are fully or partially transferred to; 3) documentation – information about the technology and its components recorded on a physical carrier (regulatory, scientific and technical, design, construction, manufacturing documentation, reports on the results of patent and market, scientific, research, design and construction works, official tests of technology components), that allow their use; 4) intangible asset – intellectual property item(s), as well as items subject to other similar rights recognised as an item of property rights following the procedure established by law; 5) know-how – technical, organisational or commercial information obtained through experience and testing of technology and its components, which: is not a matter of common knowledge or easily accessible on the day of the conclusion of the technology transfer agreement; is material, that is, important and useful for the manufacturing of products, technological process and/or provision of services; is defined, that is, described sufficiently and exhaustively, so it is possible to check its compliance with the criteria of not being a matter of common knowledge as well as its materiality; 6) technology item – scientific and applied scientific results, intellectual property items (in particular, inventions, utility models, works of scientific, technical nature, software, trade secrets), know-how, reflecting the list, terms, procedure and sequence of operations, the process of manufacturing and/or sale and storage of products, provision of services; 7) patent freedom to operate – the characteristic of technologies and/or their components which means it is possible to make free use of them in a certain state without the risk of violating the intellectual property rights to technologies and/or components of technologies in force within its territory, certified by the protection titles of this state (patents) and certificates belonging to third parties, is established by the protection titles (patents) and certificates for these items and regulatory legal acts of the state (s) where the use of these technologies and their components is planned, as well as within a specific period of time following the validity period of protection titles (patents) and certificates for technologies and/or their components within the territory of such a state(s); 8) patent and market research – a systematic scientific analysis of the properties of technologies and their components related to their legal protection, the state of technology markets, their components and products, their status as to patent and licensing requirements, the nature of manufacturing; 9) technology market – a system of interconnections between consumers of technologies and their components and/or competing suppliers of these technologies and their components, aimed at meeting public and state needs for relevant technologies, their components and products manufactured using them; 10) technology component – a part of technology that reflects individual elements of technology in the form of scientific and applied scientific results, intellectual property items, know-how; 11) technology – the result of scientific and technical activities, a set of systematised scientific knowledge, technical, organisational and other decisions on the list, term, procedure and sequence of operations, the process of manufacturing and/or sale and storage of products, provision of services; 12) dual-use technologies – technologies that, in addition to civilian purposes, can be used for the development, manufacturing or use of weapons, military or special equipment; 13) technology transfer – the transfer of technology that is formalised by entering into a bilateral or multilateral agreement between individuals and/or legal entities, which establishes, changes or terminates property rights and obligations in relation to the technology and/or its components; 14) the authorised body for the development and implementation of state policy in the field of technology transfer – the main body in the system of central executive authorities that develops and ensures the implementation of state policy in the field of science and innovation; 15) the authorised body for the implementation of state policy in the field of technology transfer – the central executive body that implements the state policy in the field of scientific, scientific and technical as well as innovative activities.
