LAW OF UKRAINE This Law determines the legal, social, economic, environmental and organisational bases for production (extraction) and use of alternative types of fuel, as well as stimulation of the increased share of their use to 20 per cent of the total fuel consumption in Ukraine until 2020. SECTION I. GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: alternative types of fuel – solid, liquid and gas fuel which is an alternative to relevant traditional types of fuel and is produced (extracted) from non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials; wastes – slags and wastes from industry, agriculture, municipal and other enterprises that may be a source or raw material for the extraction or production of alternative types of fuel; non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials – raw materials of plant origin, wastes, solid fuels, other natural and artificial sources and types of energy raw materials including oil, gas, gas condensate and oil and gas condensate depleted, non-industrial and technogenic deposits, heavy grades of oil, natural bitumen, gas-saturated water, gas hydrates, etc., the production (extraction) and processing of which requires the use of new technologies and which are not used for production (extraction) of traditional types of fuel; consumers of alternative types of fuel – individuals and legal entities that use technical equipment, including internal combustion engines, boiler units, furnaces, other power generating units, systems and machines, that fully or partially operate on alternative types of fuel; field of alternative types of fuel – the field of activity related to the production (extraction), transportation, storage and consumption of alternative types of fuel; biological types of fuel (biofuel) – solid, liquid and gas fuel produced from biologically renewable raw materials (biomass) that may be used as fuel or a component of other types of fuel; biocomponent – biofuel used as a component of other types of fuel; biomass – a non-fossil biologically active renewable substance of organic origin, capable of biodegradation, in the form of products, wastes and residues of forestry and agriculture (crop production and livestock) fishery and industries technologically related to them as well as bidegradable component of industrial and domestic wastes; bioethanol – dehydrated ethyl alcohol made from biomass or raw ethyl alcohol to be used as biofuel; biobutanol – butil alcohol made from biomass used as biofuel or biocomponent; biodiesel fuel (biodiesel) – methyl and/or ethyl esters of higher organic acids obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats that are used as biofuel or biocomponent; biogas – gas obtained from biomass that is used as fuel; biohydrogen – hydrogen obtained from biomass; it is a type of biogas; biofuel producer – a business entity that directly produces biofuel from biomass; additives based on bioethanol – biocomponents of motor fuel obtained by means of synthesis using bioethanol or by mixing bioethanol with organic compounds and fuel obtained from raw hydrocarbons, the content of bioethanol in which fulfils the requirements of regulatory acts and which are categorised as biofuel; liquid fuel from biomass – diesel biofuel, bioethanol, biobutanol, pure oil and other synthetic fuels, made from biomass; synthetic biofuels – synthetic hydrocarbons and mixtures of synthetic hydrocarbons made from biomass. Article 2. Core principles of state policy in the field of alternative types of fuel The core principles of state policy in the field of alternative types of fuel shall include: promotion of the development and rational use of non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials for the production (extraction) of alternative types of fuel in order to save fuel and energy resources and reduce Ukraine’s dependence on their import; gradual increase in the share of production and use of biofuel and mixed motor fuel determined by standards. 1391-XIV
