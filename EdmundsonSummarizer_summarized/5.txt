quarantine fishery isolators are fishery technological reservoirs, fishery basins, closed water supply installations, etc., in which aquaculture objects are kept in a state of isolation without direct or indirect contact with other groups of hydrobionts in order to monitor the manifestations or absence of clinical signs of infectious diseases and, in case of necessary, diagnostic testing or treatment; marine culture (marine aquaculture) are actions related to the breeding, support and cultivation of aquaculture objects in the inland sea waters, territorial sea and exclusive (marine) economic zone of Ukraine by use of floating gardens, other technological devices with sea water; semi-intensive form of aquaculture is an organisational and technological form of fishery activity in the field of aquaculture, carried out with the use of separate means of intensification, as well as with limited artificial feedings of various nutritional value; scientific and biological rationale is a document containing rationale for various measures related to aquatic bioresources and/or their habitat by virtue of the analysis of scientific, scientific-practical, statistical and other data; non-native species of hydrobionts are species or subspecies of aquatic bioresources that are not present in the area of their natural dissemination due to biogeographic reasons; aquaculture objects are hydrobionts used for breeding, support and cultivation in aquaculture conditions; floating fish garden is a technological device that is located in a water object (part of it) that is not connected with the bottom used for intensive aquaculture form; flood spillway is a structure designed for automatical discharge of excess water from a water object during a spring high water or flood; natural feed supplies of water objects (natural feed base) is a complex of living plant and animal organisms and their dead remains (detritus), used by hydrobionts as natural feed; aquaculture products are all types of aquaculture objects obtained in the result of economic activities, as well as food and non-food products made from them, including food and fertilised caviar, related to agricultural products; reacclimatisation of hydrobionts are the actions of hydrobionts migration (re-acclimatisants) into water objects (parts of them) of their natural range in order to restore or replenish the population of those species of organisms which are considered missing or are on the verge of extinction in places of natural dissemination; recreational services in the field of aquaculture are actions related to the organisation of recreation, including granting the right to carry out amateur and sports harvesting (catching) of aquaculture objects, as well as creating conditions for monitoring hydrobionts in order to meet aesthetic and cognitive needs; replacement broodstocks of aquaculture objects are different age groups of hydrobionts, including their sexually mature individuals (producers), aimed to obtain sexual products (reproductive cells) and/or offspring of aquaculture objects;
