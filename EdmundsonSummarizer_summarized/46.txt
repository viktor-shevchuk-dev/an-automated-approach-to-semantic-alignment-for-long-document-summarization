LAW OF UKRAINE This Law defines the legal, economic, environmental and organisational principles of the use of alternative energy sources and promotes the expansion of their use in the fuel and energy sector. Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: aerothermal energy shall mean the energy which is saved up in the form of heat energy in the air environment; alternative energy sources shall mean renewable energy resources which include solar, wind, geothermal, hydrothermal, aero thermal energy, wave and tidal energy, hydro energy, biomass energy, landfill gas, gas from sewage treatment plants, biogas, and secondary energy resources which include blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, methane gas for coalbed degasification and conversion of waste energy potential of technological processes; alternative energy engineering shall mean the sector of energy engineering, providing the generation of electrical, thermal and mechanical energy from alternative energy sources; geothermal energy shall mean energy stored in the form of thermal energy under a solid layer of the land surface; hydrothermal energy shall mean energy stored in the form of thermal energy in surface waters; energy generated from alternative sources shall mean electrical, thermal and mechanical energy that is produced at alternative energy facilities and can be a marketable product intended for sale; alternative energy facilities shall mean energy generating and other equipment that produces energy by means of alternative energy sources, the share of which is not less than 50 per cent of the installed capacity of all energy sources involved in the facility; alternative energy sector shall mean activity related to the use of alternative energy sources for the production, supply, transportation, storage, transmission and consumption of energy produced from alternative sources; renewable energy sources shall mean renewable non-fossil energy sources, namely solar, wind, aero thermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, wave and tidal energy, hydro energy, biomass energy, landfill gas, gas from sewage treatment plants, biogas; wind power plant shall mean a group of wind power plants or a separate wind power plant, equipment and facilities located in a certain area, which are functionally interconnected and constitute a single complex designed to produce electricity by converting the kinetic wind energy into electricity; wind electrical installation shall mean an electrical installation that converts the kinetic wind energy into electrical energy; production of pieces for the electric power facility equipment shall mean activities related to the production, which includes the implementation of a sufficient level of production and technological operations, the results of which change the classification code of goods according to the Ukrainian Commodity Coding System (UKT ZED) at the level of any of the first four characters, and the operations carried out in the production process should not be simple assembly operations pursuant to the provisions of customs legislation; guarantee of electricity origin shall mean a document issued by an entity authorised by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine at the request of the electricity producer, which confirms that the share or a certain amount of electricity is produced from renewable energy sources (and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used); “green” tariff shall mean a special tariff at which the electricity generated by electric power facilities, in particular at the commissioned construction stages of electric power plants (start-up facilities) that use alternative energy sources (and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) is purchased; micro-hydroelectric power plant shall mean an electric power plant that produces electricity through the use of hydro energy, the installed capacity of which does not exceed 200 kW; mini hydroelectric power plant shall mean an electric power plant that produces electricity through the use of hydro energy, the installed capacity of which is more than 200 kW, but does not exceed 1 MW; small hydroelectric power plant shall mean an electric power plant that produces electricity through the use of hydro energy, the installed capacity of which is more than 1 MW, but does not exceed 10 MW; stage of a power plant construction shall mean a group of electrical installations or a separate installation, equipment and facilities located in a certain area, which are functionally interconnected and form a single complex designed for electricity generation, which according to the construction design documentation is a part of the electric power facility. The stage of a power plant construction may comprise start-up complexes; administrator of the electronic trading system shall mean a legal entity designated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine under the law to be responsible for ensuring the functioning of the electronic trading system; support quota distribution auction (auction) shall mean a method of determining business entities that acquire the right to obtain support in electricity production from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used); auction price shall mean the price of 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity offered by the business entity, which has been recognised as the winner of the support quota distribution auction; electronic trading system shall mean a two-tier information and telecommunication system consisting of a central database and electronic platforms that interact through the application programming interface, which is provided in the form of open access code and determines the electronic trading system functionality. The electronic trading system provides the ability to create, place, publish and exchange information and documents in electronic form, necessary for the electronic auction; electronic platform shall mean a hardware and software complex operating on the Internet, connected to a central database and providing the auction customer, persons intending to participate in the auction, and participants with the opportunity to use electronic trading system with automatic exchange of information on the auction process in electronic form; energy cooperative shall mean a legal entity established pursuant to the Law of Ukraine “On Cooperation” or the Law of Ukraine “On Consumer Cooperation” to carry out economic activities for the production, procurement or transportation of fuel and energy resources, as well as to provide other services to meet the needs of its members or territorial community, as well as for gaining proceeds, under the law; annual quota of support for business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources shall mean the amount of the capacity of electric power facilities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used), which is proposed in the relevant year for distribution at auction, as a result of which business entities acquire the right to support; electronic platform operator shall mean a legal entity authorised to use the electronic platform and act under the agreement concluded with the administrator of the electronic trading system; central database shall mean a set of hardware and software in the databases and the auction module, which provide the possibility of conducting the auction in electronic form and guarantee equal access to information for auction participants in electronic form”; The terms “electricity producer”, “consumer”, “guaranteed electricity buyer (guaranteed buyer)”, “transmission system operator” shall be used in this Law in the meanings given in the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Market”. The term “ultimate beneficial owner (controller)” shall be used in this Law in the meaning given in the Law of Ukraine “On Prevention and Counteraction to Legalisation (Laundering) of the Proceeds of Crime or Terrorist Financing and Financing Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction”. 555-IV
