LAW OF UKRAINE This Law is aimed at ensuring the protection of people and the environment from the harmful impact of radioactive waste at present and in the future. The Law applies to all activities with radioactive waste. Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Basic terms, concepts and their definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following terms and concepts shall apply: Radioactive waste producers are legal entities or individuals, whose activities cause the generation of radioactive waste; Long-lived radioactive waste is radioactive waste, the level of exemption of which from the control of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety is reached in 300 years or more; Disposal of radioactive waste is the placement of radioactive waste in a facility intended for radioactive waste management without the intention of using it; Storage of radioactive waste is the placement of radioactive waste in a facility, which provides its isolation from the natural environment, physical protection and radiation monitoring, as well as the possibility of subsequent retrieval, processing, transportation and disposal; Immobilization of radioactive waste is the conversion of radioactive waste into other forms by means of solidification, embedding in any kind of matrix or containment; State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories is a summary of systematised information about the facilities for storage or disposal of radioactive waste; Radioactive waste conditioning is operations on the preparation of radioactive waste for transportation, storage and disposal. The conditioning can be carried out by placing radioactive waste into a container or immobilising it; Short-lived radioactive waste is radioactive waste, the level of exemption of which from the control of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety is reached earlier than in 300 years; Facility intended for radioactive waste management is a structure, premises or equipment intended for the collection, transportation, processing, storage or disposal of radioactive waste, as well as a nuclear installation under decommissioning after it is recognized as an installation for radioactive waste management; Radioactive waste treatment are operations designed to ensure safety or save costs by changing the characteristics of radioactive waste; Radioactive waste processing is any operation that changes the characteristics of radioactive waste, including pre-treatment and conditioning; Radioactive waste management are all activities (including decommissioning) related to the operation, pre-treatment, treatment, conditioning, transportation, storage or disposal of radioactive waste; Pre-treatment of radioactive waste is decontamination, collection, and sorting of radioactive waste; Radiation safety during radioactive waste management is non-exceeding the permissible limits of radiation exposure on personnel, the population and the environment established by regulations, rules, safety standards, as well as restraint of the migration of radionuclides into the environment; Radioactive wastes are tangible objects and substances, the activity of radionuclides or radioactive contamination of which exceeds the limits established by current regulations, given that the use of these objects and substances is not provided for; State Register of Radioactive Waste is a consistent current record of special-form acts on the generation, physical and chemical composition, volumes, properties, as well as transportation, storage and disposal of radioactive waste; Exemption level is the limit of the activity or radioactive contamination established by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety, at which or below which radioactive waste can be released from the control of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety; Specialised enterprise for radioactive waste management is an enterprise (association) that collects, processes, transports, stores and (or) disposes of radioactive waste on the basis of a licence; Radioactive waste repository is a structure for storage or disposal of radioactive waste with a mandatory provision of engineering, geological, physical and other barriers that prevent the migration of radionuclides; Physical protection during radioactive waste management is a set of organisational and technical measures aimed at preventing unauthorized access to radioactive waste and its use, timely detection and suppression of actions aimed at violating the inviolability of radioactive waste.
