If the application of the law of a foreign state depends on reciprocity, it shall be deemed to exist as long as there is no evidence on the contrary. A rule of law of a foreign state shall be not applied in cases where its application leads to consequences that are clearly contrary to the foundations of legal order (ordre public) of Ukraine. Grounds and legal consequences of recognising an individual as missing or declaring him or her dead are regulated by the last of the known lex personalis of this person. In the absence of such conditions or if they cannot be established, the law of the state in which the executive body of a legal person is located shall apply. Obligations arising as a result of acquisition or preservation of property without sufficient legal grounds shall be regulated by the law of the state in which such actions took place. The law chosen in accordance with part one of this Article shall cease to apply or be changed by agreement of the parties in the event of a change in lex personalis or habitual place of residence of the spouse to whose lex personalis or habitual place of residence the chosen right was linked. Where, in violation of the rules of international law, Ukraine, its property or representatives in a foreign state are not provided with the same judicial immunity as according to parts one and two of this Article is provided to foreign states, their property and representatives in Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine may take appropriate measures permitted by international law against that state, its property, unless diplomatic measures are sufficient to resolve the consequences of the said violation of international law.
