On the direction with significant passenger traffic as well as in resorts, recreation areas, dense residential development and high levels of environmental pollution, the preference is given to creating routes (lines) of municipal electric transport. Discharging of the public policy in the field of municipal electric transport is carried out by means of: formation of the regulatory framework for its functioning; implementation of the government control over its technical condition and ensuring of traffic safety; promoting the implementation of investment and innovation projects in this field; support of domestic manufacturers of rolling stock and equipment; ensuring the protection of rights of consumers of transport services. Officials and other authorised employees of the central executive authority that ensures the implementation of the public policy on safety issues on the land transport have also the other rights established by legislation. When verifying compliance with the requirements of legislation on municipal electric transport the carrier is obliged to render all necessary documents and develop appropriative conditions for its implementation. The carrier has the right to: introduce proposals about creating new and making changes to existing routes (lines) as well as clarification of the volume of transport work and work schedule; perform control over the observance by passengers of the Rules for using municipal electric transport, including fare and availability of documents giving the right to preferential travel; cut back the passenger transportation on the routes (lines) or temporarily change the schedule in case of threat to its safety, changes in passenger flows as well as for other reasons independent of the carrier and immediately inform the customer about it; require the compensation of losses for temporary closure or obstruction in movement, except for cases stipulated by Article 19 of this Law. Accepting and dismissal of the head from the occupied position is agreed with the central executive authority, which ensures the formation and implementation of public policy in the field of transport within the scope of their powers. In case of emergencies, natural disaster (flood, fire, snowdrifts) accidents and catastrophes that have led to disruption of municipal electric transport, the carriers shall take immediate measures to eliminate their consequences.
