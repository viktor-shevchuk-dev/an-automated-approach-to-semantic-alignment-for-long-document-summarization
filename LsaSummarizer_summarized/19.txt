Over the past 5–10 years, real opportunities for further growth of hydrocarbon reserves, discovery and exploration of deposits of new types of minerals for Ukraine, namely gold, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, rare and rare-earth elements, lithium, niobium, tantalum, phosphorites, fluorite, stone-coloured raw materials, etc., have been confirmed. Ukraine may reduce the import of chromium concentrates from Kazakhstan and Russia (from Don and Saransk Mining and Processing Plants) in the coming years due to the exploration and commissioning of Kapitanivka chromite deposit on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. Such alloys are high-tech (well welded, solid, while plastic, and therefore retain their properties and shape in extreme conditions of their operation (high and ultra-high temperatures, pressure), producing incandescent production filaments with extended service life, cathode heaters, thermocouples. Seven kimberlite bodies, manifestations of lamproite magmatism, a significant number of massifs of ultramafic alkaline rocks and carbonatite-like formations, as well as numerous finds of diamonds and their satellite minerals in secondary reservoirs represented by terrigenous deposits of different ages (from Coal to Quaternary period) have been identified in the Pryazovia region. In this direction, the following is planned: conducting search and exploration works within Pobuzke ore district (Kirovohrad and Mykolaiv oblasts), aimed at replacing imported raw materials with their own; conducting search and evaluation works within Tarnavatskyi Massif or another promising object with the selection of serpentinite samples for laboratory and technological studies to extract magnesium oxide and metallic magnesium from them; evaluation of iron ochre and nontronites of the serpentinite residual soil (except for nickel content) for their suitability as raw materials (naturally doped) to produce iron ore pellets. It is offered to implement a method for obtaining phosphorous mineral fertilizers (containing calcium, magnesium and silicon), which excludes the use of sulfuric acid and the formation of gypsum as production waste, by incomplete reduction of phosphates by coal when heated to 800–1200 °C directly from phosphorus-containing ores to solve these problems. Some of them are already unsuitable for operation due to the development of the territory, the extraction of gravel and pebble deposits of the Carpathian rivers, pollution of aquifers within land reclamation systems, in areas where filter storage facilities, artificial dumps, landfills, etc., are located.
