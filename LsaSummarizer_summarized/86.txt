When a person is approached in connection with his or her possible appointment as an arbitrator, he or she shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to reasonable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence. An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to reasonable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence, or if he or she does not possess qualifications required by the parties. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the authority specified in Article 6 to decide on the termination of the mandate; such a decision shall be subject to no appeal. The parties shall be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and any meeting of the arbitration tribunal for the purposes of inspection of goods, other property or documents. In all cases, the arbitration tribunal shall make a decision according to the terms of the contract and take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction. If an application for setting aside or suspension of an arbitration award has been made to a court referred to in paragraph 5, subclause 1, clause 1 of this Article, the court where recognition or enforcement is sought may, if it considers it proper, adjourn its decision and may also, on the application of the party claiming recognition or enforcement of the arbitration award, order the other party to provide appropriate security. The procedure for enforcement of the security provided under Article 4 of this Statute shall be determined by the President of the Maritime Arbitration Commission upon entry into force of its award.
