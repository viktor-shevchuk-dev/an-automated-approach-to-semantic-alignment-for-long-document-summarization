The electronic trading system provides the ability to create, place, publish and exchange information and documents in electronic form, necessary for the electronic auction; electronic platform shall mean a hardware and software complex operating on the Internet, connected to a central database and providing the auction customer, persons intending to participate in the auction, and participants with the opportunity to use electronic trading system with automatic exchange of information on the auction process in electronic form; energy cooperative shall mean a legal entity established pursuant to the Law of Ukraine “On Cooperation” or the Law of Ukraine “On Consumer Cooperation” to carry out economic activities for the production, procurement or transportation of fuel and energy resources, as well as to provide other services to meet the needs of its members or territorial community, as well as for gaining proceeds, under the law; annual quota of support for business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources shall mean the amount of the capacity of electric power facilities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used), which is proposed in the relevant year for distribution at auction, as a result of which business entities acquire the right to support; electronic platform operator shall mean a legal entity authorised to use the electronic platform and act under the agreement concluded with the administrator of the electronic trading system; central database shall mean a set of hardware and software in the databases and the auction module, which provide the possibility of conducting the auction in electronic form and guarantee equal access to information for auction participants in electronic form”; The terms “electricity producer”, “consumer”, “guaranteed electricity buyer (guaranteed buyer)”, “transmission system operator” shall be used in this Law in the meanings given in the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Market”. Incentives for the production of electricity from alternative energy sources provided for in this article shall apply to: business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), regardless from the installed capacity of such facilities, construction stages (start-up complexes), which were commissioned by 1 January 2020; business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), which have been commissioned since 1 January 2020, and in accordance with Article 9-3 of this Law shall not be obliged to participate in auctions; business entities intending to produce electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) and in accordance with part 4 of Article 71 of the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Market” have concluded electricity sale contracts at a “green” tariff until 31 December 2019 and put such facilities into operation within two years from the date of these contracts for the facilities producing electricity from solar energy, and within three years from the date of conclusion of these contracts for the facilities generating electricity from other types of alternative energy sources; consumers of electricity, including energy cooperatives, private households, generating installations of which produce electricity from alternative energy sources and for which a “green” tariff has been set. The “green” tariff has been set for each business entity producing electricity from alternative energy sources, for each type of alternative energy and each electric power facility or each stage of a power plant construction (start-up complex), taking into account the provisions of this article, Article 9 -2 and Article 9-4 of this Law. To the “green” tariff for electricity produced from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at the electric power facilities, including the power plant construction stages (start-up complexes), commissioned from 1 July 2015 until 31 December 2024, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission shall establish a premium for compliance with the level of use of the equipment produced in Ukraine at the relevant facilities, as specified in Article 9-2 of this Law. The State shall guarantee that the business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources at the commissioned electricity facilities, shall be subject to the procedure for stimulating the electricity production from alternative energy sources established pursuant to the provisions of this Article on the date of power facilities commissioning, including the commissioned power plants construction stages (start-up complexes), producing electricity from alternative energy sources. The state shall guarantee the enshrining in law for the entire “green” tariff validity period and the period of support for producers of electricity from alternative energy sources, which by the auction acquired the right to support, the requirements for the purchase in each billing period of electricity produced at the electric power facilities, including on the power plants construction stages (start-up complexes) that use alternative energy sources (and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used), at the set “green” tariff or at auction price taking into account the premium established under this Article, in the amounts and in the manner specified in Articles 68, 71 and 74 of the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Market”, as well as for payments for such electricity in the certain period and for funds.
