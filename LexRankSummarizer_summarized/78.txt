Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: main pipeline — a technological complex which functions as an integrated system and which consists of the separate pipeline with all facilities and structures connected to it within a joint technological process, or a number of pipelines which perform transit, interstate, interregional deliveries of transported products to consumers, or other pipelines designed and constructed according to the state construction requirements for the main pipelines; industrial pipelines (connected networks) — all other non-main pipelines laid at production facilities, as well as at oil and gas storage facilities, intra-facility oil, gas and product pipelines, urban gas, water, heat, sewer distribution networks, water supply distribution pipelines, land reclamation systems, etc; technical corridor — a land lot within boundaries of which had been laid a system of pipelines and communications; executive survey — placement of the facility on a land use plan and on other cartographic sources; flaw detection of the internal cavity of the pipeline — process of determining, recording or transmitting of geometric, physical and other parameters of the pipeline and its anti-corrosion coating, which defines its technical reliability, using a set of sensor placed inside the pipeline; diagnostics — a set of technical measures to determine the technical parameters of the pipeline; pipeline transport infrastructure — main and industrial pipelines, including ground surface, above ground and under ground linear parts of pipelines, as well as facilities and structures, main and auxiliary equipment that ensure safe and reliable operation of pipeline transport; protected area — land strips along main and industrial pipelines, around industrial facilities that ensure normal operating conditions, prevent damage, as well as aimed to reduce negative impact on people, adjacent land lots, nature sites and environment in general. Legislation on pipeline transport and its purpose Relations in the field of pipeline transport are regulated by the Law of Ukraine “On Transport”, by this Law and by other legislative acts of Ukraine. According to the conditions established by this article, to perform the functions of an underground gas storage operator, only underground gas storage facilities (one or several) can be transferred. Relations of pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations with local state executive authorities, representative bodies and local self-government bodies, enterprises, institutions and organizations Local bodies of state executive power, representative bodies and local self-government bodies within the limits of their powers: approve locations for structures and other pipeline transport facilities on land lots allocated for use by pipeline transport enterprises in accordance with the Land Code of Ukraine; take measures to ensure safety of operation of pipeline transport facilities by enterprises, institutions and organizations; participate in preparing and coordinating plans for protection of personnel and population, in joint measures on performing works during a state of emergency; notify and inform the public about protection measures and rules of conduct during a state of emergency, as well as during the operation of pipeline transport facilities and involve specialists of pipeline transport enterprises to such activities; accept Executive survey materials from enterprises, institutions and organizations of pipeline transport and provide them to other enterprises, institutions and organizations in accordance with the procedure approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Organizational structure of pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations The organizational structure of pipeline transport enterprises (except for the Gas Transmission System Operator), institutions and organizations depends on the tasks assigned to them, determined by the enterprises, institutions and organizations themselves, and approved by the bodies that manage assets of these enterprises. Pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations must ensure: supply to customers of hydrocarbons, chemical products, water and other products and substances according to contracts; adhering to current safety and technical operations norms and rules, to rules of fire safety and environmental protection; that infrastructure, built (reconstructed) is commissionned for operations without violation of norms and rules; diagnostic monitoring of pipeline conditions with functional tools and in accordance with the rules of technical operation and the legislation acts on diagnostics; technical re-certification of pipeline transport infrastructure after it reached operational lifetime limit and in case of premature aging, fatigue, partial loss of reliability or safety; conservation of pipelines, if for any reason they don't function for more than one year, ensuring constant technical oversight over pipeline in order to support operability; transfer of the executive survey information, prepared in a duly manner by construction organisations and by customer to the local state executive authorities and to the local self-government bodies in order to place that information at the district land use maps, that in a duly manner provide information about location of pipelines to relevant enterprises, institutions and organisations. Persons become liable for violation of the legislation on pipeline transport if they are guilty of: failure to adhere to the requirements of the Rules of security measures for main pipelines; intentional damage, destruction and stealing of pipeline transport infrastructure equipment, stealing of products transported by the pipeline transport and also damage to environment; allowing use of defected construction and structural materials, fit-out equipment for the pipeline transport infrastructure; creating obstacles for performance of works (measures), related to prevention and recovery from disaster aftermaths, accidents and catastrophes by state executive authorities, enterprises, institutions and organizations, and also by individual citizens; violation of safety rules by the pipeline transport enterprises, including environmental safety rules; failure to adhere to the directives and prescriptions issued by state control and oversight authorities; failure to execute approved cooperation plans while performing works in a state of emergency.
