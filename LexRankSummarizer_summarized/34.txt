Legislation on combined production of heating and electric energy (co-generation) and usage of residual/waste energy potential Relations in the field of combined production of electric and heating energy are regulated by the Law of Ukraine “On Energy-Saving”, this Law and other legal acts. Section II PUBLIC POLICY ON COMBINED PRODUCTION OF HEATING AND ELECTRIC ENERGY Article 5. Principles of the public policy on the use of co-generation units The public policy on the use of co-generation units is based on the principles of: development and balanced use of co-generation units in the national economy; facilitating the restructuring of existing heat generation facilities into combined electric and heating energy units to increase fuel efficiency and environmental safety; creating distributed (local) electricity generation capacity as a condition for improving the reliability and safety of energy supply at the regional level; government regulation of relations in this area; economic incentives for the use of co-generation units in enterprises, irrespective of their form of ownership or sectoral affiliation; ensuring free access of government regulatory authorities to information on the condition of co-generation units and volumes of electric and heating energy production. Government regulation and incentives in the use of co-generation units Government regulation in the use of co-generation units is carried out by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving, the national commission for state regulation of energy and public utilities, and central executive authorities authorised by the President of Ukraine in the relevant fields of activity in the manner prescribed by Ukrainian legislation. Government regulation in the field of the use of co-generation units is carried out by: the qualification of co-generation units; licensing economic activities for combined heating and electric energy production; setting tariffs for heat produced by co-generation units; supervising and monitoring the safe execution of work in the construction or reconstruction of co-generation units. In cases where technical conditions envisage the reconstruction or modernisation of heat grids or technological equipment of the owner of the heat grid related to the connection of the co-generation unit, the owner (user) of the co-generation unit is entitled to apply to the central executive authority in the field of heat supply for an expert opinion on the technical feasibility of technical requirements for the connection, the scope of work. Rules for connecting co-generation units to the heat grid are set by the central executive authority in the field of heat supply.
