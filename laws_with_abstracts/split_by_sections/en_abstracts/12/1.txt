According to Article 1 of the Law, a civil association is a voluntary association of natural persons and/or privately owned legal entities to exercise and protect the rights and freedoms, and satisfy community interests, particularly economic, social, cultural, environmental and other ones. By its organizational and legal form, a civil association is created as a civil organization or a civil union. A civil organization is a civil association whose founders and members (participants) are natural persons. A civil union is a civil association whose founders are privately owned legal entities, while its members can be privately owned legal entities as well as natural persons. A civil association can function with or without a legal entity status. A civil association with a legal entity status is non-business entity, whose main objective is not generation of profit.
