A civil association registered according to the procedure established by law can have the status of a national association, if it has remote divisions in the majority of administrative territorial units, and if it confirms such status according to the procedure established by the Law. Specialized laws may determine other requirements for confirming the national status of some types of civil associations. Confirming the national status of a civil association and renouncing such status is voluntary. To confirm its national status, a civil association submits an application according to the form established by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine to the authorized body in the issues of registration (Article 19 of the Law).
