The name of a civil association is determined by decision of the founding meeting, during its creation. The name of a civil association consists of two parts â€“ the general and the personal name. The general name designates the organizational and legal form of the civil association ("civil organization", "civil union"). The name of a civil association is stated in the official language. A civil association can also state its personal name in a foreign language or a national minority language, in addition to the official language (Article 10 of the Law).
