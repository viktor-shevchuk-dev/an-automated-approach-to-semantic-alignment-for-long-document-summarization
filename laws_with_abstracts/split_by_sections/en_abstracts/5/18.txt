Xenogenic and foreign species of aquatic organisms can be used in aquaculture provided that measures are taken to prevent their uncontrolled spreading in new habitats, or any negative impact on the populations of local aquatic biological resources or the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Entities involved in aquaculture can breed and/or grow xenogenic and foreign species of aquatic organisms in open and/or enclosed conditions on the basis of a scientific biological feasibility study, with mandatory notification of the central executive authority that implements state policy in the sphere of fishery. The scientific biological feasibility study on breeding and/or growing of certain xenogenic or foreign species of aquatic organisms is carried out by scientific institutions within the sphere of management of the central executive authority that implements state policy in the state of fishery, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine (Article 20 of the Law).
