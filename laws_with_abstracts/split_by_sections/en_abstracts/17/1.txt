According to Article 1 of the Law, a refugee is a person who is not a citizen of Ukraine, is outside of the country of their citizenship owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, citizenship (allegiance), membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country, or, being a stateless person outside of the country of their previous permanent residence, cannot or does not wish to return to such country due to the above apprehension. A person in need of subsidiary protection is a person who is not a refugee according to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, and this Law, but requires protection due to being forced to arrive in Ukraine or remain in Ukraine because of the threat to their life, security or liberty in their country of origin caused by fear of the death penalty exercised against them, or of the sentence of death, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. Persons in need of asylum are foreigners and stateless persons permanently residing in a country that shares a border with Ukraine, which are forced to seek protection in Ukraine en masse, due to external aggression, foreign occupation, civil war, conflicts on the grounds of ethnicity, natural or man-made emergencies, or other events that disrupt public order in a certain part or entire territory of their country of origin.
