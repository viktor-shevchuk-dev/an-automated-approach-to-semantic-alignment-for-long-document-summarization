The Code determines the procedure of division of the property (acquired before, as well as during marriage) between members of married couple after breaking of family relations. It is stipulated that the property acquired by a man and a woman who live as one family, but are not married, shall belong to both of them, if otherwise is not set by a written agreement between them.
