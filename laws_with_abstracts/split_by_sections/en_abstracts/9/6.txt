According to Article 6 of the Law, funds paid under a court resolution to collect funds according to the Law are considered losses of the state budget. The official or civil servant of a state body, state enterprise or legal entity, whose actions resulted in losses of the state budget is liable according to law. By request of a body of the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, prosecutor bodies address the court in the interests of the state, with claims to compensate losses incurred by the state budget. If, according to a court resolution that has become final, a component of crime was found in the actions of the official or civil servant of a state body, state bodies shall, according to the procedure established by the legislation, exercise the right of exoneration (recourse) against such person to compensate the losses incurred by the state budget, in the amount of the compensation paid, unless otherwise established by the legislation. After exercising court resolutions on collecting funds from accounts where state budget funds are booked, state bodies shall, in cases determined by the Law, hold an internal investigation in respect of involved officials and civil servants of such state bodies, if no component of crime was found in the actions of the above persons according to a court resolution that has become final. Based on the results of the internal investigation and by request of the bodies of the State Treasury Service of Ukraine with appropriate materials enclosed, state bodies and prosecutor bodies may address a court with a claim application to compensate the losses incurred by the state budget and present the officials and civil servants of such bodies that are responsible for these losses (except for compensation of payments related to labor relations and moral damages) with exoneration (recourse) demands. If the losses incurred by the state budget resulted from joint actions or inaction of several officials or civil servants, such officials or civil servants shall bear solidary liability according to law.
