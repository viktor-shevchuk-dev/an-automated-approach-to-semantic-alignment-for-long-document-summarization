Transplanting organs and other anatomic material from the donor to the recipient is carried out according to the procedure established by the law, at their consent or the consent of their legal representatives, provided that the use of other means and methods for life support, or health restoration or improvement does not yield desired results, and the harm caused to the donor is less than the threat to the recipient. Donation of organs and other anatomic material can be done by an adult legally capable person. A natural person can issue written consent to donate their organs and other anatomic material after their death, or to forbid such donation. Collecting organs and other anatomic material from the body of a deceased natural person is not allowed, except for cases and according to the procedure established by the law (Article 47 of the Foundations).
