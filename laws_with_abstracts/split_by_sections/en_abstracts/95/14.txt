Chapter IV of the Fundamentals is dedicated to ensuring healthy and safe conditions of living. The State ensures a standard of living, which includes food, clothes, accommodation, medical care, social services and provision, which is necessary to maintain a person's health. To this end, based on scientifically founded medical, physiological, sanitary and hygienic requirements, unified minimal norms are established for wages, pensions, stipends, social benefits and other population incomes; the most vulnerable population groups are provided (including free of charge) with food products, clothes, medicines and other prime necessities; a set of measures is organized in order to provide for the living needs of the refugees, the homeless and other people without a definite place of residence; persons in a difficult material situation that presents a risk to their life and health are provided with free medical aid and social security (Article 25 of the Fundamentals).
