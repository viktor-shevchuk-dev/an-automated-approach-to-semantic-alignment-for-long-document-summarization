Criminal proceedings are held in the official language. The prosecution, the investigating magistrate and the court prepare procedural documents in the official language. A person is informed of their being suspected of a criminal offence in the official language, or in any other language they speak well enough to understand the essence of the suspicion of a criminal offence. The investigating magistrate, the court, the prosecutor and the investigator shall provide those parties of the criminal proceedings that have insufficient or no grasp of the official language with the right to give evidence, make petitions, file complaints and speak in court in their native language, or another language they can speak, with the use of an interpreter when necessary, according to the procedure provided by the Code. Court resolutions that conclude the essential court proceedings are provided to the parties of the criminal proceedings, or to the person in whose respect a decision was made to apply compulsory medical treatment or measures of educational influence, translated to their native language or another language they speak. Other procedural documents of the criminal proceedings, the copies of which must be provided according to the Code, are translated only by petition of the above persons. Translations of court resolutions and other procedural documents of the criminal proceedings are certified by the translatorâ€™s signature (Article 29 of the Law).
