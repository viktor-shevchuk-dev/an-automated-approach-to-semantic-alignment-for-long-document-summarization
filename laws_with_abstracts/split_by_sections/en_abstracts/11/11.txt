According to Article 32 of the Code, criminal proceedings are carried out by the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the criminal offence was committed. If several criminal offences were committed, criminal proceedings are carried out by the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the graver offence was committed, and if the gravity of the offences is the same, the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the most recent criminal offence was committed. If it is impossible to determine the place of the criminal offence, criminal proceedings are carried out by the court within whose territorial jurisdiction pre-trial investigation was completed.
