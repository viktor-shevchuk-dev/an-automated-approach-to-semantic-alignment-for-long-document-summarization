A court of cassation checks the correct application of the norms of material and procedural rights by the court of first instance and the court of appeal, and their legal treatment of the circumstances; it has no right to examine evidence, establish or recognize circumstances that were not established in the court resolution being contested, or to decide on the credibility of any piece of evidence. A court of cassation reviews the court resolutions of the court of first instance and the court of appeal, within the scope of the cassation appeal. A court of cassation has the right to exceed the scope of the cassation remands if this does not aggravate the condition of the convict, acquitted or a considered for compulsory medical treatment or measures of educational influence. If satisfying the appeal provides grounds to make a decision in favor of other convicts who did not file appeals, the court of cassation must make such a decision. (Article 433 of the Code).
