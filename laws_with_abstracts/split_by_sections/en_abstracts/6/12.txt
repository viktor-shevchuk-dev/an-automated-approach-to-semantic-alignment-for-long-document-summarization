Article 16 of the Law envisages that charity organizations have property rights and other corporeal rights for funds, securities, land plots, other movable and immovable property, and intangible assets, unless otherwise established by law or their constituent documents. The use of assets (incomes) and legal relations of charity organizations must not be in conflict with legislative acts and the objectives of charity work. The amount of administrative expenses of a charity organization must not exceed 20% of the organizationâ€™s income in the current year. Expenses related to managing charitable endowments are included in the administrative expenses of the charity organization, unless otherwise established by the legislation or by legal relations between the charity organization and the benefactor. Charity organizations have the right to carry out non-profit business activity that facilitates achieving their statute objectives.
