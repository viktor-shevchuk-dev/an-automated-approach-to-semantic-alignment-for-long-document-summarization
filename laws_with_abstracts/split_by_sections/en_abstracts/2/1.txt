Article 1 of the Law provides definitions of terms used in it. For example, higher education is a collection of systematized knowledge, skills and practical aptitudes, manners of thought, professional, worldÂ­view and social qualities, moral and ethical values, and other competences, acquired in a higher educational institution (research institution) in an appropriate field, in a certain qualification, at higher education levels that are more complex than the full secondary education level.
