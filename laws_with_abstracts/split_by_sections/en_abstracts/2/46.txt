Direct management of the work of a higher educational institution is carried out by its head (rector, president, supervisor, director, etc.). Their rights, obligations and responsibility are determined by the legislation and the statute of the higher educational institution. Every year, the head of a higher educational institution reports to the founder (founders) or their authorized body (person), and the supreme collegial civil self-government body of the higher educational institution. The head shall publish an annual report of their activity on the official website of the higher educational institution (Article 34 of the Law).
