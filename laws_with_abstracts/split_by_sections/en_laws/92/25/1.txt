When executing works in the right-of-way of a motor road, street and railway crossing, if this threatens the safe or uninterrupted movement of vehicles and pedestrians, organisations responsible for the maintenance of the road, street and railway crossing may prohibit or restrict traffic based on the warrant approved by the National Police, which is issued by the relevant road authority, and in cities â€“ by the service of the local state executive authority and local government. The warrant shall set out conditions for prohibiting or restricting traffic, the procedure for informing participants in road traffic about this, road safety measures and timing of the work.
