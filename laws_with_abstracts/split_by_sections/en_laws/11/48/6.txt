5. Defence counsel shall have the right to participate in interviews and other proceedings conducted with the participation of the suspect or accused, to meet the suspect confidentially prior to the first interview, without authorisation of the investigator, public prosecutor, court, and, after the first interview, to have such consultations without any limitation with regard to their number and duration. Such consultation may take place under visual control of an authorised official but in the environment which precludes wiretapping or listening-in.
