9. In exceptional cases with a view to ensure security of a witness to be examined, the court, proprio motu or upon the motion of the parties to the criminal proceedings or of the witness himself/herself, passes a reasoned ruling to examine the witness concerned with the use of technical means from another premise, including outside court’s building, or in other way making his/her identification impossible, and ensures the parties to criminal proceedings the possibility to ask questions and hear answers thereto. If there is a danger that witness’s voice can be identified, examination may be accompanied by acoustic disturbance. Before such ruling is made the court shall establish whether the parties to the criminal proceedings have any objections to the examination of a witness in the conditions making his/her identification impossible and, where founded, decline to have the witness examined under the rules of this part.
