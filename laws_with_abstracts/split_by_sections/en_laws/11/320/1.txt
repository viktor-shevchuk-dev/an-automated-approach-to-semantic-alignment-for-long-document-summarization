1. Public prosecutor, upon having established in the course of pre-trial investigation that the suspect unconditionally has admitted his/her guilt, does not dispute circumstances established through pre-trial investigation, and agrees to the consideration of the indictment in his/her absence, and the victim and representative of the legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken do not object against such consideration, shall have the right to refer to court an indictment containing inter alia a motion on consideration thereof in simplified procedure, without conducting judicial proceedings in court session.
