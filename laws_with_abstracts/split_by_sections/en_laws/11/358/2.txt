2. Whenever the court sustains such motion of the public prosecutor, the court is required to adjourn the trial for the time needed for the preparation of defence against a new charge or preparation of a representative of the legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken and for the public prosecutor to comply with provisions of Articles 276–278, 290–293 of this Code, but not more than for fourteen days. The time of adjournment may be extended by the court on a motion of the defence or the representative of a legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken if the scope or complex nature of the additional charge require more time for the preparation of defence.
