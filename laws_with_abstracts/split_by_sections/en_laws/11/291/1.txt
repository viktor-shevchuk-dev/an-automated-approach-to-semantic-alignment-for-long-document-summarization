1. The suspended pre-trial investigation shall be renewed by a decision of the investigator or public prosecutor where the reasons for its suspension no longer exist (the suspect has recovered from the illness, his/her whereabouts have been established, the procedural actions within the framework of the international co-operation have been completed), as well as where it is necessary to conduct investigative (detective) or any other procedural actions. A copy of the decision on renewal of the pre-trial investigation shall be sent to the defence, the victim, and the representative of the legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken.
