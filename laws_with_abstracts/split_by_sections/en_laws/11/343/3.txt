3. Where defence counsel is no longer able to participate in the court proceedings, the judge presiding in the court session shall propose to the accused to select another defence counsel within three days. If in criminal proceedings where the participation of defence counsel is mandatory, the appearance at court session of the defence counsel selected by the accused is not possible within three days, the court shall postpone the trial for a period necessary for the defence counsel to appear, or concurrently with postponing the trial, shall involve a defence counsel to provide defence by appointment.
