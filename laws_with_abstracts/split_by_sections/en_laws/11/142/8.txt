8. A person shall receive the summons or be notified of it by other means not later than three days before the day when he/she shall arrive on summons. Where this Code sets deadlines for procedural actions that do not allow to make a summons within the specified period, a person shall receive a summons or be notified of it in another way as soon as possible, but in any case with the required time to prepare and arrive on summons.
