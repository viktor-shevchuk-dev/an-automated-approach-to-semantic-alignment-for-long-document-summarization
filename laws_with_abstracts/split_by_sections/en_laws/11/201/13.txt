6. An investigating judge or a court may consider a motion for selection of such measure of restraint as putting into custody in absence of a suspect or accused solely in the case where a public prosecutor apart from the circumstances stipulated by Article 177 of this Code will prove that the suspect has been announced into international search. That being the case, upon apprehension of the person and no later than forty eight hours upon his/her delivery to the venue of criminal proceeding, the investigating judge or a court will, in the presence of a suspect or accused, decide whether to apply custody or a milder measure of restraint and will render a ruling thereupon.
