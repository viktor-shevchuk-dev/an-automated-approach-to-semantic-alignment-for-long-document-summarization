Tariffs for thermal energy production for the needs of institutions and organisations financed from the state or local budget, as well as for the needs of the population shall be determined for business entities that produce thermal energy in plants using alternative energy sources, including heat and power plants, thermal power plants and co-generation units, as the difference between the tariff for thermal energy established in accordance with part four of this Article and the tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy, which are determined at the level of tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy produced using natural gas, for the needs of the relevant category of consumers. In case of the absence of established tariffs for a business entity for transportation and supply of thermal energy produced using natural gas, for the needs of the relevant category of consumers, tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy shall be determined at the level of weighted average tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy.
