The lessee is obliged to return the vessel to the lessor in the condition in which they received it, taking into account normal wear and tear. If the condition of the vessel deteriorates, the lessee shall compensate the lessor for the resulting losses. Improvements made by the lessee to the vessel, if they can be separated, may be withdrawn by the lessee if the lessor does not agree to reimburse their value.
