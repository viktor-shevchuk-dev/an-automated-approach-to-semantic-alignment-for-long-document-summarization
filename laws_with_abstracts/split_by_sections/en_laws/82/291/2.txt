For the purposes of this chapter, a collision of vessels shall be equated with the cases where losses are caused by one vessel to another or to persons, cargo or other property on the vessel, by the performance or failure to perform a manoeuvre or failure to comply with the rules of navigation, even if there is no physical collision of the vessels in question.
