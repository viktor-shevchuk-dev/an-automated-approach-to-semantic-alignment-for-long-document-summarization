If the policyholder deliberately fails to provide the information in a timely manner or at all or deliberately misdeclares the cargo or the insured amount, the insurer shall have the right to refuse the insurance under the general policy. However, the insurer shall retain the right to the insurance premium that it would have received had the policyholder fully complied with the marine insurance contract in good faith.
