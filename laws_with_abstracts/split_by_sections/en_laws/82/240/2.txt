If the marine insurance contract is concluded for the benefit of a third party, the policyholder shall bear all the obligations under the contract. The same obligations shall be borne by the person in whose favour the contract was concluded if it was concluded upon the agency of that person or even in the absence of the agency, but that person later agreed to the insurance.
