If the resident parent does not give a consent certified by a notary for the child to travel abroad for the designated purpose within ten days upon receiving the notice by certified mail, the non-resident parent, provided that they do not have any child support payments in arrears, may request the court to award the permission for the child to travel abroad without the consent of the other parent.
