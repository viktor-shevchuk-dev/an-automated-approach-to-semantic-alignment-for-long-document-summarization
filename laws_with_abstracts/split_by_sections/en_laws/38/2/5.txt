structural elements of the environmental network are territories of the environmental network that differ in their functions. Structural elements of the environmental network include key, connecting, buffer and renewable areas. Key areas ensure the preservation of the most valuable and typical regional components of landscape and biodiversity. Connecting territories (eco-corridors) connect key territories, provide animal migration and exchange of genetic material. Buffer territories provide protection of key and connecting territories from external influences. Restored territories ensure the formation of the spatial integrity of the environmental network, for which priority measures must be taken to restore the original natural state.
