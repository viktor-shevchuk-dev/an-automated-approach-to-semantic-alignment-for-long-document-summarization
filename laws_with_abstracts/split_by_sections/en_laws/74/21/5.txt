The rights of railway undertakings (carriers) to cargo accepted for transportation are protected on the same basis as the rights of the cargo owners. The carriers shall have the right to demand the return of illegally possessed cargo as well as the reimbursement of damages caused by theft, destruction, or confiscation thereof (for the possibility of return to its owner).
