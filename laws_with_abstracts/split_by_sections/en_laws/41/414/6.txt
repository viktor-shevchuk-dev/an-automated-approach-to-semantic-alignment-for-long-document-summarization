6. If the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court concludes that there are no grounds for referring the case for its consideration, and if it concludes on unreasonableness of consideration of the case by the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court, in particular due to the absence of an exclusive legal problem, a conclusion on application of a rule of law in the similar legal relations set out in a previously adopted judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court, or if the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court has already expressed a legal position as to the jurisdiction of the dispute in similar legal relations, the case shall be returned (referred) to the relevant panel (chamber, joint chamber). A case returned to the panel (chamber, joint chamber) for consideration may not be re-referred to the Grand Chamber for consideration.
