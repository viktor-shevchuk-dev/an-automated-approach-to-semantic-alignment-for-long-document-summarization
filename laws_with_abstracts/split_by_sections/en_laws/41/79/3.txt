In cases on recognition of assets as unfounded and on cases of their recovery in state revenue, the plaintiff shall provide actual data in the claim confirming the relationship of assets with a person authorised to perform the functions of state or local government, and their invalidity, that is the difference between the value of such assets and the legal income of such person, as defined in part 2 of Article 290 of this Code. If the court finds that these facts are sufficiently proven, by virtue of the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, the refutation of the fact that the assets are unfounded shall be entrusted to the defendant.
