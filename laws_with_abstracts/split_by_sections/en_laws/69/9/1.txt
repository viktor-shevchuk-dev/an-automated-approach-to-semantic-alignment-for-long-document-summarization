Owners and lessees of land plots situated within the area of agricultural lands shall have the right for the period of the lease contract to exchange the rights of each other in relation to the use of land plots by means of concluding mutual contracts of lease and sublease of the relevant land plots. In such an event, the conclusion of the lease contract does not provide for the consent of the lessor, whereas the lessee shall remain liable to the lessor for the execution of the lease contract. Termination of one of the land lease or sublease contracts concluded within the frameworks of exchange of rights of use shall terminate another lease or sublease contract concluded in substitution, to be compulsorily specified in such contracts.
