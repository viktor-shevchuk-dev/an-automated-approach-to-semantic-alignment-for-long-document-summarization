A leased land plot or a part thereof may be subleased by the lessee without changing its intended purpose if this is provided for in the lease contract or with the written consent of the lessor (except in cases determined by law). If the lessor does not send a written notice of its consent or objection within one month, the leased land plot or part of it may be subleased.
