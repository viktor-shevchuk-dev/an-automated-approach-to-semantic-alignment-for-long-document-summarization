If the wording of the reason for dismissal is found to be incorrect or inconsistent with applicable law, in cases where this does not entail the reinstatement of the employee, the body reviewing the labour dispute shall change the wording and indicate in the decision the reason for dismissal, in accordance with the wording of current legislation and with reference to the relevant Article (paragraph) of the law. If the incorrect wording of the reason for dismissal in the employment record book prevented the employment of the employee, the body reviewing the labour dispute shall simultaneously decide to pay him the average salary for the period of forced absence in the manner and under the conditions provided for in part 2 of this Article.
