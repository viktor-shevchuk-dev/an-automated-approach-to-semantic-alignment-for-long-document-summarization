When concluding an employment contract on remote work, the owner or the body authorised by him should ensure compliance with clause 2 of part one of this Article and also provide the employee with recommendations for working with equipment and tools that the owner or his authorised body provides the employee to perform a certain amount of work. Familiarisation can take place in the form of distance instruction or through training in safe working methods on a specific technical equipment. An employment contract, by agreement of the parties, may provide for additional labour safety conditions.
