Familiarisation of employees with orders (commands), messages, other documents of the owner or the body authorised by him regarding their rights and obligations is allowed using the means of electronic communication specified in the employment contract. In that case, the fact of exchange, between the owner or his authorised body and the employee, of the corresponding electronic documents is considered to be a confirmation of familiarisation.
