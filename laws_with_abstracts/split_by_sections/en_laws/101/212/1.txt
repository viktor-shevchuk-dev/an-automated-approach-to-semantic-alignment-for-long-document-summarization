Parents, foster parents and guardians of a minor, as well as state agencies and officials responsible for supervision and control over the compliance with labour legislation, may demand the termination of the employment contract with a minor, including a fixed-term contract, when the prolongation of such employment threatens the minor's health or violates his/her legitimate interests.
