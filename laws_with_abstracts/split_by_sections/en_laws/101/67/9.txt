An employee who performs remote work is guaranteed a period of free time for rest (disconnection period) wherein the employee may interrupt any information and telecommunication with the owner or their authorised body, and this is not considered a violation of the employment contract or labour discipline. The free time for rest (disconnection period) is defined in the remote employment contract.
