If several trade union organisations have been created at an enterprise, institution, the organisation they should, on the basis of proportional representation (according to the number of members of each primary trade union organisation), form a joint representative body to conclude a collective contract. In this case, each primary trade union organisation should decide on its specific obligations regarding their fulfilment under the collective contract and responsibility for their failure. A primary trade union organisation that refuses to participate in a joint representative body is deprived of the right to represent interests of workers when signing the collective contract.
