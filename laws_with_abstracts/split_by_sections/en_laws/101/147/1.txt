In determining the amount of damage to be compensated, the court takes into account the degree of guilt of the employee and the specific circumstances wherein the damage was caused in addition to the direct actual damage. When the damage has become not only the result of the employee's culpable conduct but also of the lack of conditions to ensure the safeguard of material valuables, the amount of coverage should be reduced accordingly.
