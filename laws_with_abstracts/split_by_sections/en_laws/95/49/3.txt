If the failure to obtain consent may lead to serious consequences for the patient, the physician must explain it to him or her. If the patient still refuses treatment, the physician has the right to take written confirmation from him or her, and if it is impossible to obtain it, the physician shall certify the refusal by an appropriate act in the presence of witnesses.
