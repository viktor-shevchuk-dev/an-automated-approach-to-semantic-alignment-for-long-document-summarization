To facilitate their activities, healthcare facilities may also establish boards of trustees, which (with their consent) may include philanthropists, public representatives and members of civil, charitable, religious organisations, local governments, the media, as well as volunteers and others. The Head of a healthcare facility or the entitled authority shall approve decisions on the trustee board establishment at a healthcare facility with the regulations on it.
