2. For applications for five-year patents, in whose respect the decision to grant a patent was taken before the enforcement of this Law but neither the state registration, nor the publication of the information about the issue of patents have been effected, the NIPO shall issue declarative patents for inventions and publish the information about the issue thereof subject to the payment of an appropriate state duty.
