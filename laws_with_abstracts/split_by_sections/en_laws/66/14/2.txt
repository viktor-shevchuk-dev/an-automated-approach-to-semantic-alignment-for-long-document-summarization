Professional certification of contractors (service providers) related to the creation of architectural works is carried out by the central executive authority that implements the state policy in the field of architecture. Powers to conduct professional certification may be delegated to self-regulatory organisations in the field of architectural activities. A self-regulatory organisation acquires the powers delegated to it/ceases to perform the powers delegated to it from the date of entering information on the decision of the central executive authority implementing state policy in the field of architecture on the delegation of such powers/termination of the delegated powers into the Unified State Electronic System in the field of construction.
