1. Subject to any contrary agreement by the parties, the arbitration tribunal shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or oral argument, or whether the proceedings are to be conducted based on documents and other materials. However, unless the parties have agreed that no hearings shall be held, the arbitration tribunal shall hold such hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by any party.
