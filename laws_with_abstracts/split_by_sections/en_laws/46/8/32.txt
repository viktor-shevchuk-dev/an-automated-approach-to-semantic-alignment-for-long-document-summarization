If at the electric power facilities, including on the commissioned power plant construction stages (start-up complexes), producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and in case of using hydro energy, only by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants), according to this article, different “green” tariff coefficients should be applied, the separate commercial accounting shall be set on this facility for each stage (start-up complex) and/or for the installation where the separate “green” tariff coefficient is applied.
