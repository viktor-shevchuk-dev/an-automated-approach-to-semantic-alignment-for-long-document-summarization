If the party fails to submit the evidence required by the court without reasonable excuse or without notifying the reasons, the court, depending on which person evades their submission and what significance this evidence has, may recognise the circumstance, for the clarification of which the evidence was required, or refuse its recognition, or to consider the case on the evidence available in it, and in case the plaintiff fails to submit such evidence, the statement of claim shall also be left without consideration.
