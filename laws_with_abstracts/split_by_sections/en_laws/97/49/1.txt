1. Third parties who do not declare independent claims on the subject of a dispute may intervene in a case on the part of a plaintiff or a defendant before the end of the preliminary proceedings or before the first court hearing if a case is considered in the simplified action proceedings, if the court ruling may affect their rights or obligations towards one of the parties. They may also be involved in a case at a request of the case parties.
