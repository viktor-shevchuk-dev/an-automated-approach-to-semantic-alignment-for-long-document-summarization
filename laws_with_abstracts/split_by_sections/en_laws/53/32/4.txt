The influence of potential sources-groundwater pollutants located within the second and third zones of the sanitary protection zone and which, for technical reasons, cannot be taken outside these zones (oil pipelines, product pipelines, filtration fields, cattle burial grounds, etc.), shall be determined for each such an object separately by virtue of the results of studying the migration of pollutants in the environment. With a significant technogenic load within the second and third zones of the sanitary protection zone, in order to control the operation of drinking water supply sources and the adoption of water management decisions, constant monitoring studies shall be carried out.
