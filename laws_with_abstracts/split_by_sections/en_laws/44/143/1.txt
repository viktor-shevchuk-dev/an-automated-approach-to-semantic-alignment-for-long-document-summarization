1. If necessary, orphanages shall be set up in correctional facilities where women sentenced to imprisonment serve their sentences. Convicted women shall have the right to settle their children under the age of three in an orphanage. An orphanage at a correctional facility is a child-care facility. In the orphanages, children shall be under the care of the administration of the child-care facility with full state support and conditions necessary for their normal life and development. If a convicted woman has not expressed a desire to live in an orphanage together with her child, she shall be allowed to communicate freely with her child without restrictions. It shall not be considered a restriction on a womanâ€™s communication with her child if she is required to visit her child during her time off from her duties.
