Penalties and other sanctions for non-payment of customs duties and for other violations detected in connection with the incorrect classification of goods shall be applied by the customs authorities only if the decision taken by the customs authority to classify these goods in a complicated case was made on the basis of unreliable documents or information provided by the declarant and/or as a result of the applicant's failure to provide all the information available to it and necessary to make the said decision, which significantly affected the nature of this decision.
