The owner of the land plot may also set a requirement that the contracts on granting the right to use the land plot for agricultural purposes (emphyteusis) or for the construction (superficies) are subject to the notarial certification, as well as cancel such a requirement. Setting (cancellation) of the requirement shall be a unilateral deed subject to notarial certification. Such a requirement is an encumbrance of property rights to the land plot and shall be subject to state registration in the manner prescribed by law.
