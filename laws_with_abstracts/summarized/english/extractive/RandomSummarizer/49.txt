Information and scientific support for the implementation of the National Programme includes, in particular: organisation of work on scientific research of the processes of unification and harmonization of law in Ukraine and in the EU Member States, in the states of Central and Eastern Europe seeking EU membership; organisation of work on translation of the EU legislation and providing consultations on the use of the legal terminology and methodology; constant informing of the state authorities about the legislation of the European Union, changes and amendments to it, ensuring effective and full access to the European legal, bibliographic and other databases of participants in the process of adaptation of the legislation of Ukraine.
