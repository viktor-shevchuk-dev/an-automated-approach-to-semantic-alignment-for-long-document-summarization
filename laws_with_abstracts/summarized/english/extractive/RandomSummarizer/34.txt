Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: released energy – electric or heating energy supplied to consumers from a co-generation unit; additional fuel – fuel that is burned permanently or temporarily in the combustion products of the main fuel to increase the electric and/or heating capacity of the co-generation unit; efficiency of using additional fuel – the ratio of the increase in the amount of released energy (electrical and/or heat energy) supplied by the co-generation unit during the year, due to the combustion of additional fuel during the specified period, to the energy of such additional fuel; qualification of a co-generation unit – determination by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving that the conditions and indicators of the co-generation unit operation meet the requirements (qualification indicators) of this Law; qualified co-generation unit – a co-generation unit, the conditions and performance of which meet the requirements of this Law; co-generation unit – a set of equipment that works by the method of combined production of electric and heating energy or converts the discharge energy potential of technological processes into electric and heating energy; combined production of electric and heating energy (co-generation) – a method of simultaneous production of electric and heating energy within one technological process as a result of fuel combustion; main fuel – fuel that ensures the efficiency of the co-generation unit, including the discharge energy potential of technological processes; the discharge energy potential of technological processes – secondary energy resources that can be used to produce electric and heating energy in co-generation units. Section II PUBLIC POLICY ON COMBINED PRODUCTION OF HEATING AND ELECTRIC ENERGY Article 5. If the combustion of additional fuel is used to maintain the design electric capacity of the co-generation unit while temporarily reducing the thermal capacity of the waste energy potential in relation to its implication adopted in the technical design of the co-generation unit, the amount of additional fuel consumption must be approved by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving; 2) traditional (organic) fuel is used as the main fuel, and the amount of supplied heat shall be at least 10 per cent of the total electric and heating energy production within one year of its commissioning and within each subsequent 12-month period; during the said period, the amount of supplied electric and heating energy in relation to the main and additional fuel energy shall be at least 42 per cent. Features of connecting co-generation units to the electricity and heat grids Technical conditions for connection of co-generation units to the electrical and/or heat grid shall be provided by its owner in the manner prescribed by regulations, no later than 15 days from the date of receipt of the request. Rules for connecting co-generation units to the heat grid are set by the central executive authority in the field of heat supply. Article 13.
