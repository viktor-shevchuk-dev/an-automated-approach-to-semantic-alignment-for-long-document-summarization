The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of clauses 4 and 5 of this Article. If during arbitration proceedings, the parties settle the dispute, the arbitration tribunal shall terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the parties and not objected to by the arbitration tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitration award on agreed terms. An arbitration award on agreed terms shall be made under the provisions of Article 31 and shall state that it is an arbitration award. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within 30 days of receipt of the arbitration award, the arbitration tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitration proceedings but omitted from the award. An arbitration award may be set aside by the court specified in paragraph 2 of Article 6 only if: 1) the party making the application for setting aside furnishes proof that: a party to the arbitration agreement referred to in Article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of Ukraine; or it was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present its case; or the award was made regarding a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the arbitration agreement, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, however, if the decisions on matters covered by the arbitration agreement can be separated from those not covered by such agreement, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters not covered by such agreement may be set aside; or the composition of the arbitration tribunal or the arbitration procedure did not comply with the agreement of the parties unless such agreement was in conflict with any provision of this Law from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, did not comply with this Law; or 2) the court finds that: the subject matter of the dispute cannot be the object of the arbitration proceedings under the law Ukraine; or the arbitration award is contrary to the public policy of Ukraine. Recognition or enforcement of an arbitration award, irrespective of the country where it was made, may be refused only: 1) at the request of the party against which it is invoked, if that party furnishes to the competent court where recognition or enforcement is sought proof that: - the party to the arbitration agreement referred to in Article 7 was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or - the party against which the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present its case; or - the award was made regarding a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the arbitration agreement, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement, however, if the decisions on matters covered by the arbitration agreement can be separated from those not covered by such agreement, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters covered by such agreement may be recognised and enforced; or - the composition of the arbitration tribunal or the arbitration procedure did not comply with the agreement of the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, did not comply with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or - the award has not yet become binding on the parties or has been set aside or suspended by a court of the state in which, or under the law of which, that award was made; or 2) if the court finds that: - the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law Ukraine; or - the recognition or enforcement of the award is contrary to the public policy of Ukraine. In cases subject to the jurisdiction of the International Commercial Arbitration Court, the President of the Court may, at the request of a party, determine the amount and the form of the security.
