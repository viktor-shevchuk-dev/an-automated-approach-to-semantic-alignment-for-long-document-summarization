According to industrial and economic significance, it is planned to divide raw materials as a component of the mineral resource base of Ukraine into the following categories: Category A includes mineral raw materials that are intensively extracted in Ukraine, characterised by significant proven reserves of minerals and components and are the subject of the export or can be considered as such to provide foreign exchange earnings and revenues to the state budget in a short time; Category B includes mineral raw materials that are currently produced in Ukraine in limited volumes, the cost of production of which provides the maximum economically profitable level of profitability, development, and the proven reserves of deposits are small or depleted, and new deposits are not sufficiently studied; still, the need for such raw materials is due to the development of the industry. Imports cover the shortage of such types of mineral raw materials; Category C includes mineral raw materials with the deposits available in Ukraine and their reserves (including significant ones) explored. In this direction, the following is planned: continuation of search and evaluation works in the north-west of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield in Ustynivka ore deposit, at promising ore occurrences, namely Ustynivka, Vysoke and others, and exploration of Verbyne deposit to prepare it for industrial development; completion of a complex of drilling operations and technological research at Eastern Serhiivka ore deposit, conducting a forecast geological and economic assessment of the ore occurrence and conducting technical and economic calculations of the feasibility of mining and drilling exploration along with the exploration of Serhiivka gold deposit; conducting search operations to identify new and outline identified objects in ore occurrences (sites) of the Eastern Pryazovia region, followed by performing an assessment works complex to determine their industrial significance; conducting search and evaluation works in the central part of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield (east side of Kryvyi Rih-Kremenchuk suture zone). In this direction, the following is planned: activation of geological exploration in Transcarpathia to provide Muzhievo Gold and Metal Plant with reserves of industrial categories of gold ores and increase the promising resources of the area and prepare for the operation of Bobryk deposit in the Donets Basin; strengthening of search and evaluation works in the Donets Basin to study the terrigenous-carbonate strata of the Southern Donets Basin with rich ores of the Carlin-type; continuation of search and evaluation works on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield within the prospective structures of known ore fields and zones (Verkhivtseve, Surske and Chortomlyk green-stone structures of the Middle Prydniprovia region, Savranske-Kapustinske, Klyntsivka-Yurivka ore fields in gneissic strata) and within the potential ore fields of other regions, as well as within the newly discovered green-stone structures (ore occurrences of Andriivskyi, Sorokyne, Popelnaste, Zelenodolsk, Vilnyi Khutir, Haichyr, Kvitka, Orikhove, Kapustiany, Pivdennopolianytskyi); conducting search and evaluation works on promising areas of Berehove and Vyshkivske ore fields, as well as on areas and sites of Rakhiv ore district, exploration of Berehove field, as well as the flanks of Muzhievo deposit; study of black-shale strata of the Donets Basin, promising for the detection deposits of Kokpatas, Bakyrchik, Murun-Tau type; implementation of a comprehensive geological and economic assessment of the forecast resources of the identified gold deposits of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield (Shyroka Balka and Serhiivske deposits in Dnipropetrovsk oblast; Klyntsi, Hubivka and Yurivka in Kirovohrad oblast; Maiske deposit in Odesa oblast); continuation of work on the geological study of gold deposits in the Transcarpathia (including the completion of exploration of the flanks of Muzhievo and Sauliak deposits; an increase in gold reserves at the main part of Berehove deposit with a concomitant increase in silver, lead and zinc reserves; assessment of the resources of Skhidnozhuravske and Berezivka silver deposits; preparation for industrial development, calculation of silver reserves of Zhuravske and Skhidnozhuravske deposits; discovery of new deposits within the promising structures of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield).
