Child 1. The child may be adopted without the consent of the adult parents if the court established that the parents have not been living together with the child for over six months without any valid reasons, and do not provide parental care and support to the child. In case adoption is terminated under Clause 1, Part 1, Article 238 of this Code and where the child is not given to their parents, the court may award a judgment to collect child support from the former adoptive parent; provided, however, that such former adoptive parent is capable of doing so. If the adoptive parent was registered as the mother/father of the adopted child, their parental rights may be terminated under Article 164 of this Code. If the parental rights of the adoptive parent were terminated, Article 166 of this Code shall apply. Child custody/guardianship 1. The person who is fostering an orphan child or a child deprived of parental care shall have the rights and obligations regarding raising and protecting this child as envisaged by Article 249 and Article 262 of this Code.
