11) licensing – issuance, modifications, re-issuance, suspension and withdrawal of licences, issuance of duplicate licences; conducting licensing cases, control over observance by licensees of the terms of licensed activity established by norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety and physical security of nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, other ionising radiation sources; issuance of orders to eliminate violations of the licensed activity terms; 13) re-issuance of licence – issuance of a licence by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety using a new form to replace the current one, taking into account the conditions based on which the current licence was issued and changes that became the basis for its re-issuance; 14) radioactive materials – any materials containing radionuclides in which the specific activity, as well as the total activity, in case of their transportation exceeds the limits established by norms, regulations and standards on nuclear and radiation safety; 15) reactor facility – an installation and its safety-related systems during the operation of which a controlled nuclear fission chain reaction takes place to obtain the final product (neutron flux, electricity, radioactive isotopes); 16) approval certificate in case of radioactive material transportation – a document confirming the compliance of organisational measures and technical means, important to nuclear and radiation safety during transportation of radioactive materials, to the requirements of norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety; 17) process owner in the field of nuclear energy use (hereinafter – process owner) – as prescribed by law, a registered legal entity (enterprise, institution or organisation of any form of management) or a sole proprietor who performs or declared its intention to perform the activity in the field of nuclear energy use, in respect of which this Law establishes the requirements of compulsory licensing, certification or registration. Basic principles of permitting activities in the field of nuclear energy use The basic principles of permitting activities in the field of nuclear energy use are: priority of ensuring nuclear and radiation safety over other interests; differentiated approach to different activities and ionising radiation sources, taking into account the related potential nuclear and radiation hazards; objectivity of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety in assessing the level of safety and decision-making; validation of the established criteria, requirements and conditions for ensuring safety in the field of nuclear energy use, taking into account the full range of environmental, economic and social factors; responsibility of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety for compliance with the established permitting procedures and sufficiency of conditions and restrictions of activity implementation set by them in the field of nuclear energy use; inadmissibility of interference of any bodies, officials and officers, citizens and their associations in resolving issues within the powers of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety, except for cases prescribed by the law; ensuring by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety the openness and publicity of permitting activities in the field of nuclear energy use. Permitting activity is an integral part of state regulation in the field of nuclear energy use and provides for: licensing of certain activities in the field of nuclear energy use; licensing of the operating organisation activity at a particular stage of the life cycle of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility and issuing certain permits to such organisation to perform certain types of works or operations at certain stages of the life cycle of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility; licensing of activity related to the direct management of reactor unit by personnel and activity of the officials of operating organisation, whose official duties include the implementation of organisational and administrative functions related to nuclear and radiation safety; issuing approval certificates in case of radioactive material transportation; state registration of ionising radiation sources; issuing permits for radioactive material transportation. Licensing of the operating organisation's activity at a certain stage of the life cycle of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility The state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety shall issue a licence to perform activities associated with a specific stage of the life cycle of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility to the operating organisation of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility that submitted an appropriate application based on a comprehensive safety assessment of nuclear facility or storage facility and an assessment of the operating organisation's ability to implement all safety measures, namely: for construction and commissioning of the nuclear facility; for construction of the radioactive waste storage facility; for the operation of the nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility; for nuclear facility decommissioning; for radioactive waste storage facility closure. Refusal to issue a licence The applicant may be refused a licence issue by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety in case of: absence or lack of documents confirming the compliance of the safety of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility with the established requirements; absence or lack of documents confirming the compliance of financial, material, other resources, organisational structure and personnel of the applicant with the requirements established by norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety to the extent required for its assurance; detection of the applicant's inability to ensure compliance with the conditions of the declared activity established by norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety; availability of inaccurate or distorted information in the documents submitted by the applicant. If the type of activity subject to licensing is carried out by branches, other separate subdivisions of the applicant, the licence shall indicate their location; identification code of legal entity or identification number of individual – taxpayer and other compulsory payments; life cycle stage of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility or a certain type of activity for the right to perform of which a licence is issued; the site boundaries where nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility is located, the place or territory of performing a particular type of activity in the field of nuclear energy use; a list of main facilities and buildings belonging to the technological complex of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility (in the licence of the operating organisation to perform activities at a certain stage of the life cycle of indicated nuclear facility or storage facility); a list of facilities, buildings, installations and processes belonging to the process complex for processing and storage of radioactive waste (in the licence for processing, storage of radioactive waste); the technological processes or types of economic activity in which the ionising radiation sources shall be used (in the licence for performing certain activities in the field of nuclear energy use); a list of documents on the basis of which a decision to issue a licence was made; a list of officials whose official duties include the implementation of organisational and administrative functions related to nuclear and radiation safety assurance, physical security of nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, and other ionising radiation sources; conditions of activity performance; a list of types of works or operations at the stages of construction and commissioning, operation and decommissioning of a nuclear facility, as well as at the stages of operation and closure of a radioactive waste storage facility, the performance of which after issuing the specific permits by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety; date of issue, validity and number of a licence.
