LAW OF UKRAINE This Law defines legal and organisational principles of permit activities in the field of nuclear energy use, as well as general provisions for regulating social relations that arise during its implementation, as an exception to the general provisions established by the Law of Ukraine “On Licensing of Certain Types of Economic Activity”. Permitting activity in the field of nuclear energy use is aimed at protecting national security interests, preventing the exceeding of permissible levels of human exposure and environmental pollution, as well as compliance with the requirements of the non-proliferation regime. SECTION I. GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Basic terms and definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: 1) use of ionising radiation sources – one of the certain activities in the field of nuclear energy use, including such kinds of activities dealing with ionising radiation sources: operation, maintenance, loading-reloading, repacking, repair, adjustment, testing with the purpose of technical characterisation and leakage check; commissioning and decommissioning of installations which have ionising radiation sources; assembling and dismantling, storage (except for transit storage during transportation), receipt (purchase) and transfer (sales), including the purpose of delivery; 2) state registration of ionising radiation sources – entering in the State Register of Ionising Radiation Sources the data on ionising radiation sources produced within Ukrainian territory or imported or exported across the state border of Ukraine, as well as on the owners of such sources, individuals and legal entities to whom they are assigned on the rights of economic control or operational management or are in their possession or use otherwise; 3) activity in the field of nuclear energy use – an activity during which the additional ionising radiation sources are used, the effect of indicated radiation extends to additional groups of people or the system of radiation directions from existing sources is changed increasing the dose or probability of exposure to people or a number of people who are being exposed; 4) permitting documents – licences, permits, including specific permits, certificates of approval in case of transporting the radioactive materials; 5) operating organisation (operator) – a state-appointed legal entity that carries out the activity related to site selection, designing, construction, commissioning, operation, decommissioning of a nuclear facility or site selection, designing, construction, operation, closure of a radioactive waste storage facility; provides nuclear and radiation safety, physical security of nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility at all stages of their life cycle and is responsible for nuclear damage; 6) life cycle stages of a radioactive waste storage facility – site selection, designing, construction, operation, closure; 7) life cycle stages of a nuclear facility – site selection, designing, construction, commissioning, operation, decommissioning; 8) life cycle of the nuclear facility or radioactive waste storage facility – a set of interrelated processes of gradual changes in the state of the nuclear facility or storage facility, starting from site selection for their location and ending with return of a site to general economic use; 9) licensee – a process owner in the field of nuclear energy use which has obtained a licence as prescribed by law to perform the activity in the field of nuclear energy use; 10) licence to perform the activity in the field of nuclear energy use – a permit issued by the authorised body of state regulation of nuclear and radiation safety certifying the licensee's right to perform the activity in the field of nuclear energy use subject to assurance of nuclear and radiation safety, physical security of nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, other ionising radiation sources; 11) licensing – issuance, modifications, re-issuance, suspension and withdrawal of licences, issuance of duplicate licences; conducting licensing cases, control over observance by licensees of the terms of licensed activity established by norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety and physical security of nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, other ionising radiation sources; issuance of orders to eliminate violations of the licensed activity terms; 13) re-issuance of licence – issuance of a licence by the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety using a new form to replace the current one, taking into account the conditions based on which the current licence was issued and changes that became the basis for its re-issuance; 14) radioactive materials – any materials containing radionuclides in which the specific activity, as well as the total activity, in case of their transportation exceeds the limits established by norms, regulations and standards on nuclear and radiation safety; 15) reactor facility – an installation and its safety-related systems during the operation of which a controlled nuclear fission chain reaction takes place to obtain the final product (neutron flux, electricity, radioactive isotopes); 16) approval certificate in case of radioactive material transportation – a document confirming the compliance of organisational measures and technical means, important to nuclear and radiation safety during transportation of radioactive materials, to the requirements of norms and regulations on nuclear and radiation safety; 17) process owner in the field of nuclear energy use (hereinafter – process owner) – as prescribed by law, a registered legal entity (enterprise, institution or organisation of any form of management) or a sole proprietor who performs or declared its intention to perform the activity in the field of nuclear energy use, in respect of which this Law establishes the requirements of compulsory licensing, certification or registration.
