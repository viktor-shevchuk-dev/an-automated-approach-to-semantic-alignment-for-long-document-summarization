THE WATER CODE OF UKRAINE All water resources (water objects) on the territory of Ukraine are the national property of the Ukrainian people, which is one of the natural bases of their economic development and social well-being. Water resources ensure the existence of people, animal and vegetal life and also are limited and vulnerable natural objects. There is a need to develop and comply with special rules of water resources use, their rational use and environmentally friendly approach due to the increase of anthropogenic loads on the environment, the development of social production and the growth of material needs. The Water Code together with organisational, legal, economic and educational actions will support the formation of water and environmental law and order and ensure the environmental safety of the Ukrainian people, as well as more efficient, scientifically grounded use of waters and protection against pollution, clogging and exhaustion.
