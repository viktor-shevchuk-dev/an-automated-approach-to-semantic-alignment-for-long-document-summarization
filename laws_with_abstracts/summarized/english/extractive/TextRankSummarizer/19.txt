According to industrial and economic significance, it is planned to divide raw materials as a component of the mineral resource base of Ukraine into the following categories: Category A includes mineral raw materials that are intensively extracted in Ukraine, characterised by significant proven reserves of minerals and components and are the subject of the export or can be considered as such to provide foreign exchange earnings and revenues to the state budget in a short time; Category B includes mineral raw materials that are currently produced in Ukraine in limited volumes, the cost of production of which provides the maximum economically profitable level of profitability, development, and the proven reserves of deposits are small or depleted, and new deposits are not sufficiently studied; still, the need for such raw materials is due to the development of the industry. Challenges are supposed to be solved by: concentration of efforts, including financial resources, on priority areas of development of the mineral resource base, search and exploration of mineral deposits, primarily strategically crucial for the national economy; activation of work on the geological study of subsurface resources using modern means of accumulation, systematisation and processing of geological information, the introduction of new methods and technologies for prospecting and exploration of mineral deposits; differential approach to the assessment of reserves and prospective resources of mineral raw materials, the introduction of rational methods for developing complex deposits and extracting related components, reproduction of the resource potential of regions with intensive extraction of mineral resources; activation of international co-operation on geological exploration, rational use and protection of mineral resources. In this direction, the following is planned: increasing the volume of geological exploration to identify the manifestations of native copper in the trap formation on the territory of the Volyn ore district; conducting prospecting and search-evaluation works at Rafalivka and Hirnytskyi ore nodes to prepare promising ore occurrences (deposits) for exploration; exploration of the most promising of the discovered deposits and preparation for industrial development with estimated reserves of 1 million tons of copper; conducting search and audit, search and evaluation works within the prospective ore occurrences of the Donets Basin in the south-western wing of Bakhmut Basin; geological and economic assessment of promising copper deposits in the Volyn ore region and promising ore occurrences in Donetsk Basin in the south-western wing of Bakhmut Basin; conducting targeted thematic and search studies on the development of forecast and search criteria for copper ore extraction associated with green-stone rock complexes (Dnipropetrovsk oblast). In this direction, the following is planned: activation of geological exploration in Transcarpathia to provide Muzhievo Gold and Metal Plant with reserves of industrial categories of gold ores and increase the promising resources of the area and prepare for the operation of Bobryk deposit in the Donets Basin; strengthening of search and evaluation works in the Donets Basin to study the terrigenous-carbonate strata of the Southern Donets Basin with rich ores of the Carlin-type; continuation of search and evaluation works on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield within the prospective structures of known ore fields and zones (Verkhivtseve, Surske and Chortomlyk green-stone structures of the Middle Prydniprovia region, Savranske-Kapustinske, Klyntsivka-Yurivka ore fields in gneissic strata) and within the potential ore fields of other regions, as well as within the newly discovered green-stone structures (ore occurrences of Andriivskyi, Sorokyne, Popelnaste, Zelenodolsk, Vilnyi Khutir, Haichyr, Kvitka, Orikhove, Kapustiany, Pivdennopolianytskyi); conducting search and evaluation works on promising areas of Berehove and Vyshkivske ore fields, as well as on areas and sites of Rakhiv ore district, exploration of Berehove field, as well as the flanks of Muzhievo deposit; study of black-shale strata of the Donets Basin, promising for the detection deposits of Kokpatas, Bakyrchik, Murun-Tau type; implementation of a comprehensive geological and economic assessment of the forecast resources of the identified gold deposits of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield (Shyroka Balka and Serhiivske deposits in Dnipropetrovsk oblast; Klyntsi, Hubivka and Yurivka in Kirovohrad oblast; Maiske deposit in Odesa oblast); continuation of work on the geological study of gold deposits in the Transcarpathia (including the completion of exploration of the flanks of Muzhievo and Sauliak deposits; an increase in gold reserves at the main part of Berehove deposit with a concomitant increase in silver, lead and zinc reserves; assessment of the resources of Skhidnozhuravske and Berezivka silver deposits; preparation for industrial development, calculation of silver reserves of Zhuravske and Skhidnozhuravske deposits; discovery of new deposits within the promising structures of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield). Scientific support For scientific support of the Programme implementation, the following is provided: scientific support of geological exploration from the forecast assessment of oil and gas-bearing areas to the search and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits; conducting scientific and methodological research aimed at improving the efficiency of geological exploration concerning metallic and non-metallic minerals, coal, methane from coal deposits; development of new and improvement of existing methods for the regional study of mineral resources; preparation of scientific developments and methodological recommendations for the integrated study of mineral resources; development of the latest methods of technological enrichment of ores, improvement of technical means for the construction of the core and deep exploration wells; scientific development and implementation of the latest environmentally friendly and safe technologies in the processes of mineral use and rehabilitation of land where mining was carried out; the development of new methods to assess the forecast and prospective resources of underground water, search and estimate the reserves of underground water deposits in the conditions of man-made load on the geological environment in Ukraine, as well as operational reserves of underground water for operational support for further improvement of water supply at the expense of these reserves of society's needs; the development and improvement of methods, implementation of scientific support for work on hydrogeological, engineering-geological and ecological-geological mapping; monitoring the ecological state of the geological environment, monitoring the geochemical state of landscapes, forecasting the development of exogenous processes in the conditions of territory intensive development, as well as scientific support during the implementation of these works. 62.7 2.12 2.12 21.46 37 -"- 600 50 50 200 300 revaluation of resources of promising facilities in the Pryazovia region Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment state budget 36.59 1.24 1.24 12.52 21.59 increase in iron ore reserves and resources, million tons 690 50 50 240 350 exploration of Serhiivske, Novoukrainsk, Pivnichnyi-Tersiansk and Pavlivske deposits (Zaporizhzhia oblast) -"- -"- 41.8 1.41 1.41 14.31 24.67 -"- 180 20 20 60 80 conducting search and evaluation works (Lenin sections No.1, 2 and 3) -"- -"- 15.67 0.53 0.53 5.36 9.25 increase in manganese ore resources, million tons 30 2 3 5 20 assessment of manganese carbonate ore resources in the Inhul-Inhulets Interfluve -"- -"- 31.35 1.06 1.06 10.73 18.5 -"- 10 1 2 3 4 conducting searches within Kostroma section of Dnipropetrovsk oblast -"- -"- 36.59 1.24 1.24 12.52 21.59 increase in chromite ore reserves and resources, million tons 11.4 0.5 0.5 4.2 6.2 preparation for industrial development, approval of reserves of individual sections of Kapitanivska ore node -"- -"- 52.24 1.76 1.76 17.88 30.84 increase in chromite ore reserves and resources, million tons 4.6 0.4 0.4 1.2 2.6 prospecting assessment and exploration of Pushkivsk, North Lypovenke and Lipniahivsk deposits in the Middle Pobuzhzhia region.
