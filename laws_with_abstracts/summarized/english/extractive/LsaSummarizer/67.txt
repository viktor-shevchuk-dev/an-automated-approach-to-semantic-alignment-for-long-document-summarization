The condition for equivalence of exchange under a barter agreement shall be the exchange of goods (works, services) at prices determined by the subjects of foreign economic activity of Ukraine on a contractual basis, taking into account supply and demand as well as other factors effective in the respective markets at the time of conclusion of barter agreements. To increase the receipts of foreign currency funds to Ukraine, stabilise the national monetary unit and rehabilitate the financial and banking system of the state as a whole, it may be prohibited to conduct goods exchange (barter) operations in the field of foreign economic activity with goods (works, services), the list of which is determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. If the debt under a barter agreement has arisen due to force majeure, the terms stipulated by part one of Article 2 of this Law shall be suspended and the default interest for their breach during the effect of these circumstances shall not be recovered. If a court, International Commercial or Maritime Arbitration Commission at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine or other authorised arbitration, including in another country, accepts a claim for debt recovery that has arisen as the result of non-compliance with the terms and other conditions defined by the barter agreement, the terms stipulated by part one of Article 2 of this Law shall be suspended and the default interest for their violation during this period shall not be paid. If a court makes a decision to dismiss the claim in whole or in part or terminate (close) the proceedings on the case or leave the claim without consideration, the terms stipulated by part one of Article 2 of this Law shall be renewed and the default interest for their violation shall be paid for per each day of delay, including the period for which these terms were suspended. Failure to submit or late submission of such information entails the accrual of default interest in the amount of one per cent of the value of exported goods (works, services) per each day of delay. Based on the results of documentary inspections, tax authorities shall be entitled to recover from the subjects of foreign economic activity of Ukraine the default interest stipulated by this Article in an undisputed order.
