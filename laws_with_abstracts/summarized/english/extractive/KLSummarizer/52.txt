If upon the entry into force of the court judgment awarding child support to be collected for the entire period until the child reaches the age of majority the child support payer continues to reside in Ukraine or returns to Ukraine for permanent residence, or any circumstances that were of relevance for determining the child support amount have changed, the court may award collecting child support on periodical basis taking into account the amount that has already been paid. In case after the eldest child has reached the age of majority neither parent applied to court seeking the determination of the amount of payment in support of other children, child support shall continue to be collected minus the equal share of the child who has reached the age of majority. The parent or other lawful representative with whom the child lives may apply to the court for a court order awarding child support to be collected as follows: one-fourth of the income of the payer per one child, one third per two children, and one half of their income per three children and more; however, not more than ten subsistence wages for the child of the relevant age per each child. The child may be adopted without the consent of the adult parents if the court established that the parents have not been living together with the child for over six months without any valid reasons, and do not provide parental care and support to the child. If the child being adopted have not reached the age of fourteen, the officials, having obtained the child's consent to be adopted, shall seek to protect the secrecy of adoption from the child. The court may award that alimony for the child be collected from the former adoptive parent, however, no longer than for a two-year period, if the child does not have parents or the parents are not capable to provide for the child; provided, however, that such former adoptive parent is able to provide such support. In case adoption is terminated under Clause 1, Part 1, Article 238 of this Code and where the child is not given to their parents, the court may award a judgment to collect child support from the former adoptive parent; provided, however, that such former adoptive parent is capable of doing so.
