Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration tribunal may, at the request of any party, order any party to take such interim measures of protection as the arbitration tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject matter of the dispute. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement its claim or defence during the course of the arbitration proceedings, unless the arbitration tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it. If during arbitration proceedings, the parties settle the dispute, the arbitration tribunal shall terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the parties and not objected to by the arbitration tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitration award on agreed terms. The arbitration proceedings are terminated by the final arbitration award or by an order of the arbitration tribunal under clause 2 of this Article. The arbitration tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitration proceedings when: - the plaintiff withdraws its claim unless the defendant objects thereto and the arbitration tribunal recognises a legitimate interest on his part in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute; - the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings; - the arbitration tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible. Within 30 days of receipt of the award, unless another period has been agreed upon by the parties: - any party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitration tribunal to correct in the award any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error or any errors of similar nature; - if so agreed by the parties, any party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitration tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific clause or part of the arbitration award. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within 30 days of receipt of the arbitration award, the arbitration tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitration proceedings but omitted from the award.
