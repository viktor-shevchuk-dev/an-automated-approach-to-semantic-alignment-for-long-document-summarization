Stimulation of electricity production from alternative energy sources The “green” tariff shall be set by the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission on electricity generated at electric power facilities, including the commissioned construction stages of power plants (start-up facilities), generating installations of private households, consumers, including energy cooperatives, from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used). Incentives for the production of electricity from alternative energy sources provided for in this article shall apply to: business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), regardless from the installed capacity of such facilities, construction stages (start-up complexes), which were commissioned by 1 January 2020; business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), which have been commissioned since 1 January 2020, and in accordance with Article 9-3 of this Law shall not be obliged to participate in auctions; business entities intending to produce electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) and in accordance with part 4 of Article 71 of the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Market” have concluded electricity sale contracts at a “green” tariff until 31 December 2019 and put such facilities into operation within two years from the date of these contracts for the facilities producing electricity from solar energy, and within three years from the date of conclusion of these contracts for the facilities generating electricity from other types of alternative energy sources; consumers of electricity, including energy cooperatives, private households, generating installations of which produce electricity from alternative energy sources and for which a “green” tariff has been set. The "green" tariff coefficient for electricity generated using alternative energy sources shall be set at the level: The “green” tariff coefficient for electricity generated by generating installations of private households using alternative energy sources shall be set at the level: The coefficient of the “green” tariff for electricity generated by generating installations of consumers, including energy cooperatives, with an installed capacity not exceeding 150 kW, shall be set at the level: Confirmation of the fact and date of the electric power facility commissioning, including the power plant construction stages (start-up complex), generating installations of consumers, including energy cooperatives, with the installed capacity not exceeding 150 kW, producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and in case of using hydro energy, only by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants), shall be a certificate issued by the authorised body certifying compliance with the completed project design documentation and confirming its readiness for operation, or a declaration on the readiness of the facility for operation registered under the legislation. For energy cooperatives producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and in case of using hydro energy, only by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants) by generating installations with an installed capacity not exceeding 150 kW, the “green” tariff shall be set and operate provided that as of the day when the “green” tariff has been set and during its operation, the number of this energy cooperative's members shall be at least 10 individuals whose share contributions shall not be less than 75 per cent of the unit trust or a municipal enterprise whose share contribution shall not be less than 25 per cent of the unit trust. If at the electric power facilities, including on the commissioned power plant construction stages (start-up complexes), producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and in case of using hydro energy, only by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants), according to this article, different “green” tariff coefficients should be applied, the separate commercial accounting shall be set on this facility for each stage (start-up complex) and/or for the installation where the separate “green” tariff coefficient is applied. Other business entities intending to produce electricity from alternative energy sources, regardless of the installed capacity of the facility and the alternative energy source (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used), may participate in auctions on a voluntary basis. The “green” tariff shall be set: a) for business entities producing electricity from solar energy and/or wind energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), by multiplying the “green” tariff by decreasing coefficients established by the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission, under Article 9-1 of this Law for the following economic entities: at the level of 0.925, for business entities producing electricity from solar energy and/or wind energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), which were commissioned from 1 July 2015 until 31 December 2019 and consist of single wind turbines with the installed power of 2000 kW and more; at the level of 0.975, for business entities producing electricity from wind energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), which were commissioned from 1 January 2020; at the level of 0.85 for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity of 1 MW and more, commissioned from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2019; at the level of 0.925, for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity of up to 1 MW, commissioned from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2019; at the level of 0.975 for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity of 1 MW and more, commissioned from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020; at the level of 0.7, for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity from 1 MW to 75 MW, commissioned from 1 November 2020 to 31 March 2021; at the level of 0.975 for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity of up to 1 MW, commissioned from 1 January 2020; at the level of 0.4, for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity from 1 MW to 75 MW, commissioned from 1 April 2021; at the level of 0.4 for business entities producing electricity from solar energy at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) with an installed capacity of 75 MW and more, commissioned from 1 January 2020; b) for business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), commissioned before 30 June 2015 and whose “green” tariff is lower than or equal to the marginal (maximum) “green” tariff, by multiplying the “green” tariff established by the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission, under Article 9-1 of this Law by a coefficient equal to 1; c) for business entities producing electricity from alternative energy sources (and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) at electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes), commissioned before 30 June 2015 and whose “green” tariff is higher than the marginal (maximum) “green” tariff, at the level of the marginal (maximum) “green” tariff.
