Special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Use of oil and gas potential subsoil, search and exploration of oil and gas fields, their operation, construction and operation of underground storage tanks for oil and gas shall be carried out only with special permits for use of oil and gas potential subsoil issued by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, under the conditions provided for by current legislation. If the discovered field or created underground storage tank extends beyond the area of oil and gas potential subsoil site provided for use for geological study, at the request of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil, the size of this site shall be increased for the same purpose without tender, if the adjacent area of oil and gas potential subsoil is not provided for use. Suspension of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil The validity of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil can be temporarily suspended exclusively as a result of measures of state geological control by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, directly or at the request of the state mining and technical, environmental and sanitary control bodies and local self-government authorities in the case of: violation by the user of oil and gas potential subsoil or his/her authorised contractor of the special permit for use of oil and gas potential subsoil or agreements on the conditions of use of oil and gas potential subsoil; occurrence as a result of work, related to the use of oil and gas potential subsoil on the site, a direct threat to the life or health of employees of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil or the population; repeated violations of environmental legislation and rational use of oil and gas potential subsoil; performance of work on the site not specified in the special permit for use of oil and gas potential subsoil, except for search and exploration of new oil and gas deposits within the area. Revocation of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Revocation of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil shall be carried out in the case of: refusal of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil to use oil and gas potential subsoil; liquidation of a business entity that has been issued a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; withdrawal in the manner prescribed by law of the area of oil and gas potential subsoil provided for use; recognition of the issued special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil as invalid; suspension of the special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and failure of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil to take measures to eliminate the causes of this suspension; the user of oil and gas potential subsoil has not started using oil and gas subsoil within 180 calendar days from the date of validity of the special permit for the use of oil and gas subsoil without valid reasons; unintended use of oil and gas potential subsoil. State control and supervision over compliance with the rules and regulations for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and the conditions of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and agreements on the conditions of use of oil and gas potential subsoil State control and supervision over compliance with the rules and regulations for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and the conditions of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and agreements on the conditions of use of oil and gas potential subsoil shall be exercised by central government bodies, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, and local self-government authorities within their competence. In case of violations, the relevant authorities can temporarily suspend the works provided for by a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil, until these violations are eliminated (suspend the special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil), as well as submit for consideration by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of industrial safety and state mining supervision the issue of deprivation of a subsoil user of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil. State registration and accounting of geological exploration works Works, related to the geological study of oil and gas potential of subsoil shall be subject to mandatory state registration and accounting, carried out in the manner prescribed by law by the relevant central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil.
