Barter operation is one of the types of export and import operations executed by a barter agreement or an agreement with a mixed form of payment. Goods under barter agreements are evaluated for the purpose of creating conditions to ensure the equivalence of exchange, as well as for customs accounting, determining insurance amounts and evaluating claims. Goods imported under a barter agreement shall be subject to import into the customs territory of Ukraine within the terms specified in such agreement. The terms foreseen by this Article shall not be renewed or interrupted. In the event of changes to the terms of the agreement that stipulates the replacement of obligations to pay for goods by a foreign counterparty in cash with obligations to supply goods (works, services), the Ukrainian supplier submits copies of agreement and additional agreements to the tax authority. The breach by a subject of foreign economic activity of Ukraine of the terms of import of goods (performance of works, delivery of services) imported under a barter agreement, stipulated by part one of Article 2 of this Law, entails the recovery of default interest per each day of delay. The total amount of the accrued default interest shall not exceed the amount of debt. Subjects of foreign economic activity of Ukraine who have conducted the export or import of works or services under a barter agreement shall be obliged to notify customs authorities. Failure to submit or late submission of such information entails the accrual of default interest in the amount of one per cent of the value of exported goods (works, services) per each day of delay.
