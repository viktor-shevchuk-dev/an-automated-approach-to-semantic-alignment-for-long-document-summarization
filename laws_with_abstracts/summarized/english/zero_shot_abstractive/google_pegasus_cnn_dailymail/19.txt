The proper provision of the economy's needs for mineral resources and their effective use is one of the most significant factors in overcoming the crisis in the Ukrainian economy .<n>Almost 20 thousand deposits and presence of 117 types of mineral resources are present in the bowels of our country .<n>The mineral resource complex provides a significant share of the gross national product . Nickel ores, gold, scandium, hafnium, amber, beryllium, phosphate raw materials, etc., are extracted in relatively small volumes .<n>Deposits of non-traditional minerals for Ukraine, namely chromium, lead, zinc, copper, molybdenum, zeolite, lithium, tantalum, niobium, rare-earth elements, fluorspar, apatite, oil shale, bischofite, etc.<n>Potential opportunities for increasing the state's export potential are associated with the initiation and significant increase of their production . Programme aims to meet the needs of the national economy in mineral resources through its own extraction .<n>Aims to reduce Ukraine's dependence on imports of mineral resources, and increase the country's export potential . The Programme's goal is to meet the urgent needs for mineral resources without depriving future generations of meeting their needs .<n>It is planned to divide raw materials as a component of the mineral resource base of Ukraine into the following categories . The Programme's main objective is to ensure a sustainable priority of meeting the growing needs of the national economy in mineral raw materials .<n>Ukraine occupies a prominent place among the CIS countries, Europe, and the world in terms of proven reserves and the extraction of mineral raw materials . As of 1 January 2010, the initial total hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern region amounted to 5,425.4 million tons of conventional fuel .<n>In the Southern region (the Black Sea region, Crimea and the shelf within the exclusive (marine) economic zone of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov) only 4.4 per cent of the initial total resources were sold . Coal in Ukraine is the only energy raw material, the reserves of which are potentially sufficient to ensure the state's energy security .<n>The need to attract external sources to meet the economy's coal needs is due to insufficient volumes of its own coking coal extraction and high sulfur content in it . Methane from coal deposits in Donetsk and Lviv-Volyn coal basins important additional resource potential .<n>No organisation has ever been engaged in targeted theoretical and practical research on the problems and possibilities of extracting natural gas from shale rocks in Ukraine .<n>Shale gas deposits are associated with shale (mudslides) of oil and gas basins . In 2010, according to the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry of Ukraine, Ukraine produced more than 202 billion kilowatts of electricity .<n>The general condition of the uranium mineral resource base is assessed as satisfactory .<n>In total, there are 54 iron ore deposits in Ukraine, of which 22 are in operation . In terms of total reserves of manganese ores, Ukraine ranks second after the Republic of South Africa .<n>Iron-manganese and manganese iron ores found in the Middle Pobuzhia can serve as a manganese ore industry reserve . The deposit's ores contain 98 per cent of oxidizing and carbonate-oxidizing varieties .<n>Ukraine may reduce the import of chromium concentrates from Kazakhstan and Russia .<n>The ores of Kapitanivka deposit and other promising sites of the Pobuzhzhia need further research . The problem of meeting the domestic industry needs in its own aluminium raw materials is very urgent .<n>According to the experts, Ukraine's projected copper needs will approach 200 thousand tons in the coming years .<n>There are two large deposits, namely Bihan and Berehove, with proven alunite ores of 290.3 and 51.4 million tons, respectively . Ukraine does not have industrial reserves of copper ores .<n>They are connected to three regions: Donetsk and Volyn-Podillia metallogenic copper ore provinces and the Ukrainian Crystal Shield .<n>Rafalivka and Hirnytskyi ore nodes have already been identified as the most promising in this territory . On the territory of Ukraine, the deposits of both metals are represented by silicate ores of the ultrabasite residual soil .<n>The green-stone belts and arrays of ultrabasites of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield are the non-traditional sources of nickel-cobalt ores .<n>There is a fairly high probability of discovering industrial facilities of the West Australian type .

In recent years, within the Eastern Pryazovia block of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield the sub-volcanic structuresore appearances of molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, lead, silver and other metals have been found .<n>The detection of a new promising tungsten-molybdenum mineralisation significantly increases Ukraine's prospects for discovering its own industrial deposits of tungsten and molybdenum . The resource potential of tantalum and niobium in Ukraine is the highest in Europe .<n>Currently, the extraction of tantalum-niobium raw materials in Ukraine is not carried out .<n>Production facilities for the production of finished products are not practically used due to the reduction in concentrate production in Russia . Lithium in micaceous minerals with a lithium oxide content of 0.2–0.6 per cent forms large accumulations in the Donets Basin .<n>The prospects for creating our own lithium mineral resource base in Ukraine and turning the country from an importer to an exporter of lithium products are quite high . Ukraine has industrial facilities and technologies to produce high-purity rare earth metals .<n>The vast territory is the largest rare-earth metallogenic province in Europe .<n>The state balance of mineral reserves includes Novopoltavka apatite-rare metal ore deposit (Zaporizhzhia oblast) Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of resources and reserves of zirconium and hafnium .<n>The prospective demand for zirconium raw materials and alloys for the period up to 2020 is estimated at 320 tons .<n>Ukraine is one of the leaders in the European subcontinent in terms of scandium resources .

Promising areas for identifying deposits of disten-sillimanite are the Pryazovia region and the northern part of Zhytomyr oblast .<n>Currently, Ukraine's annual demand for disten-sillimanite concentrates is 400 thousand tons, and it will increase in the future . The total reserves of apatite ores in Ukraine amount to 842.2 million tons of phosphorous anhydrite .<n>Every year after harvesting, the soil loses approximately 1 million tons of active substance in terms of P2O5 (phosphorus pentoxide) In recent years, the volume of mineral fertilizers in agriculture in Ukraine has decreased by 4 times .<n>The volume of consumption of phosphorous fertilizers has become 11.5 times less than scientifically based standards .<n> Efficient ecological, rational complex processing of phosphorus-containing raw materials, the product of which is the melted water-insoluble phosphates, is achieved . On the Ukraine territory, potash salts are distributed within the Dnipro-Donets Rift and the pre-Carpathian regional trough .<n>They are mainly concentrated in two (13 in total) deposits – Stebnyk with reserves of 1,626 million tons and Kalush-Holynsk – 49.9 million tons . Of all the types of natural coloured stones in Ukraine, amber is currently the most competitive.<n>The sale of ready-made, highly artistic amber products can become a reliable source of replenishment of the state treasury with funds, including foreign currency. It is planned to search for and explore limestone deposits in Vinnytsia and Khmelnytskyi oblasts .<n>There are no proven glauconite deposits in Ukraine, but quartz-glauconite sands with a glauconite content of up to 40-60 per cent are common in some regions .<n>It is planned to conduct prospecting operations on the flanks of Bihansk deposit to identify additional ore deposits to create its own raw material base .
