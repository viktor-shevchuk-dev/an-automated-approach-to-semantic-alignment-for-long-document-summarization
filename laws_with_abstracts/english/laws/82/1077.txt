The general average shall be adjusted in the manner laid down in Article 277 of this Code also when the peril causing the extraordinary costs or sacrifices has been caused by a person having a proprietary interest in the vessel, the freight or the cargo. However, such adjustment does not deprive the other parties of the general average of the right to recover from the person responsible for the loss incurred, nor does it deprive that person of possible remedies.
