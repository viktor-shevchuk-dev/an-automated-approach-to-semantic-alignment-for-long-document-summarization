The period specified in part 1 of this Article shall be calculated from the day when the injured party knew or should have known that they had suffered such damage, but not more than six years from the day of the incident causing the contamination and fifteen years from the day of the event causing the nuclear damage. If the liability of the operator of a nuclear vessel under the legislation of the state which authorised the operation of such vessel or under a special regulation of that state adopted in connection with a particular incident is insured or otherwise financially secured for a period exceeding fifteen years, the claim for compensation for damage may be settled after the end of the period for which liability was actually secured.
