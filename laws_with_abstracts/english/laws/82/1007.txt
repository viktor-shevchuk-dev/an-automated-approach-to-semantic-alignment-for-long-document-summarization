In the event of an insured event, the insurer shall be entitled to be exempted from further obligations under the marine insurance contract by payment of the full insured amount. The insurer shall, however, notify the policyholder of its intent to exercise this right within seven days from the date the notification of the insured event and its consequences has been received from the latter, and shall furthermore be obliged to reimburse expenses made by the policyholder solely for the purpose of preventing or mitigating the loss before they receive the said notification from the insurer.
