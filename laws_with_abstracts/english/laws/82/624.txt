When the whole vessel, part of a vessel or separate vessel’s premises are made available for carriage, the consignor may claim the removal of cargo that does not belong to them from the vessel, part of a vessel or vessel’s premises made available for them at the port of departure or, when the whole vessel is made available, at any port of call. If the third-party cargo has not been removed from the vessel in good time, the consignor shall be entitled to claim an appropriate reduction in the freight as well as compensation for the resulting loss.
