When not all the vessel is available for the carriage of cargo, the master may, before the end of the agreed laytime (or laytime and demurrage time), refuse to accept the cargo, which may not be loaded onto the vessel in a proper manner and without prejudice to the other cargoes, except by delaying the vessel. In doing so, the carrier shall retain the right to receive full freight.
