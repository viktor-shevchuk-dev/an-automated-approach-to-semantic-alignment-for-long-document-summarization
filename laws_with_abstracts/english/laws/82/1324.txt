If any of the claims on which the shipownerâ€™s liability may be limited are brought directly against a person for whose acts or omissions the shipowner is liable, that person shall be entitled to benefit from all the provisions for limitation of liability laid down for the shipowner, unless it is proved that the damage caused by that person was intentional.
