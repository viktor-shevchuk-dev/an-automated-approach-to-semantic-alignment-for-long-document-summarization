If not all of the vessel has been provided for the carriage of the cargo, the master shall unload the cargo, which may not be delivered to the port of destination, at another port in accordance with the consignor’s instructions. If no such instruction is received within three days of the notification, the master may unload the cargo in one of the nearest ports at their own discretion notifying the consignor thereof. The master may do the same if the consignor’s instruction cannot be carried out without prejudice to the owners of the other cargo on board.
