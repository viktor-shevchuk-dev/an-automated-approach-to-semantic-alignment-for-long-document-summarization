If the whole vessel is made available for carriage, the master shall not be entitled to refuse acceptance of the cargo delivered by the end of the laytime or the demurrage time if the parties have agreed on this, even if the acceptance and stowage of the cargo may delay the vessel longer than the stipulated period. For every extra day of delay beyond the demurrage time, the consignor shall be liable to compensate the carrier for any loss caused.
