An amount reimbursed under the general average for the sacrifice of property shall be added to these values unless this amount is already included. However, the amount of freight or fare at the shipownerâ€™s risk shall not include the wages and expenses for the maintenance of the crew, which would not have had to be paid if the vessel and cargo had been lost entirely in the circumstances which caused the general average and which were not attributable to the general average.
