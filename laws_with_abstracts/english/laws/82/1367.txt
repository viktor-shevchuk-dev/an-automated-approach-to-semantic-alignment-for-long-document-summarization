The rights and obligations of the parties to a mortgage contract as well as the procedure for its execution shall be determined by the legislation of the mortgageeâ€™s state unless otherwise stipulated by the agreement of the parties. A mortgage shall not mean alienation of the vessel to the mortgagee, nor can the mortgagor be regarded as a person who has lost the title to the pledged vessel.
