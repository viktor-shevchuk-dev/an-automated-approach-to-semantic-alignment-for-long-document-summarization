If after receipt of indemnity from the insurer it appears that the vessel has not been lost or the seized vessel or cargo are going to be released, the insurer may require the policyholder to retain the property (Article 270 and clause 4 of Article 271 of this Code) and return the insurance indemnity, except for reimbursement of partial loss if the policyholder has suffered it.
