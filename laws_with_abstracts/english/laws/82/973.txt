The marine insurance contract shall remain in force even if, at the time of its conclusion, the possibility of loss to be indemnified has passed or the loss has already occurred. However, if the insurer knew or should have known when entering into the marine insurance contract that the possibility of an insured event had passed or the policyholder knew or should have known of a loss that had already occurred and was to be indemnified by the insurer, performance of the insurance contract shall not be binding on the party who was not aware of these circumstances.
