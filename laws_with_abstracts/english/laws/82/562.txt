The legal relations between the carrier and the consignee of the cargo shall be determined by the bill of lading. The terms and conditions of the contract for carriage by sea, rather than those set out in the bill of lading, shall be binding on the consignee if the bill of lading makes reference to the document wherein they are set out.
