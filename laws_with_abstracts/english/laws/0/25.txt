Temporarily displaced higher education institutions and temporarily displaced scientific institutions have the right to use the property conveyed to them based on the economic management right for participation in civil relations, including for conducting financial and economic activities, according to the purposes of their conclusion and within the limits of their civil legal capacity. The scope of powers to manage property that has been conveyed to the economic management of temporarily displaced higher education institutions and temporarily displaced scientific institutions may be expanded in comparison with the rights temporarily granted by this Law and other regulatory acts until the time when the temporarily occupied territory returns under the general jurisdiction of Ukraine or until the date of enactment of the Decree of the President of Ukraine on the completion of the anti-terrorist operation or military operations within the territory of Ukraine. This provision does not apply to the powers to alienate property classified as key assets by temporarily displaced higher education institutions or temporarily displaced scientific institutions.
