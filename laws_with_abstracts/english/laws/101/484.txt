Annual leave at the initiative of the owner or their authorised body, as an exception, may be only shifted to another period with the written consent of the employee and in agreement with the elected body of the primary trade union organisation (trade union representative) if the early annual leave may have an unfavourable effect on the normal course of the enterprise, institution, organisation, and provided that part of the leave of at least 24 calendar days will be used in the current working year.
