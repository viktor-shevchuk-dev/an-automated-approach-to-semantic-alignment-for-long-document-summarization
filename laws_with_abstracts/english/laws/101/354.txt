At the time of epidemic or pandemic threat, the need for self-isolation of the employee in cases established by law, and/or in case of armed aggression threat, man-made or natural emergency or other emergencies, home-based work may be introduced by order of the owner or their authorised body without concluding a written home-based employment contract. The employee becomes aware of such an order within two days from the date of its acceptance but before the introduction of home-based work. In this case, the provisions of Part 3, Article 32 of this Code shall not apply.
