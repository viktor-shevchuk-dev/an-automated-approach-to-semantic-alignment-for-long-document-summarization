When imposing liability, the rights and legitimate interests of employees are guaranteed by establishing liability only for direct actual damage, only within the limits and procedure prescribed by law, and provided that such damage is caused to the enterprise, institution, organisation by wrongful acts (inaction) of the employee. This liability is usually limited to a certain part of the employee's earnings and shall not exceed the full amount of damage, except as provided by law.
