A court shall impose on an official guilty of unlawful dismissal or transfer of an employee to another job, the obligation to cover the damages caused to the enterprise, institution, organisation in connection with the payment of the employee's time of forced absence or performance of lower-paid work. Such obligation shall be imposed if the dismissal or transfer is carried out in violation of the law or if the owner or his/her authorised body has delayed the execution of the court decision on reinstatement.
