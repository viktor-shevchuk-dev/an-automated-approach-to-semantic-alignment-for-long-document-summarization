The submission of the owner or his authorized body should be considered in the presence of the employee for whom it was made. Consideration of a submission in the absence of an employee is allowed only upon his written application. At will of an employee, another person can act on his behalf, including a lawyer. If an employee or his representative did not appear at the meeting, consideration of the application would be postponed until the next meeting within the period defined in part two of this Article. In case of second non-appearance of the employee (his representative) without good reason, the submission may be considered in his absence.
