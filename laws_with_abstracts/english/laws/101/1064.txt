In case of disagreement with the decision of the labour disputes commission, the employee, owner or his/her authorised body may appeal its decision to the court within ten days from the date of delivery of an extract from the minutes of the commission meeting or its copy. The omission of the specified term shall not be a ground for refusal of accepting the application. Having recognised the reasons for the omission as valid, the court may renew this period and consider the dispute on the merits. If the missed deadline is not renewed, the application shall not be considered, and the decision of the labour disputes commission remains in force.
