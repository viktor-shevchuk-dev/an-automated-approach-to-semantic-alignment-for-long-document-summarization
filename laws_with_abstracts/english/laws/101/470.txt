The order of granting leave is determined by schedules approved by the owner or their authorised body in agreement with the elected body of the primary trade union organisation (trade union representative) and is communicated to all employees. When drawing up schedules, the interests of production, personal interests of employees and opportunities for their recreation are taken into account.
