At the time of epidemic or pandemic threat, the need for self-isolation of the employee in cases established by law, and/or in case of armed aggression threat, man-made, natural, or other emergencies, remote work may be introduced by order of the owner or their authorised body without concluding a written remote employment contract. The employee becomes aware of such order within two days from the date of its acceptance but before the introduction of remote work. In this case, the provisions of Part 3, Article 32 of this Code shall not apply.
