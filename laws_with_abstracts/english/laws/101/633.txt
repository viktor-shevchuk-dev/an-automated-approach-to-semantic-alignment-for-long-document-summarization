The wage amount for the first half of the month is determined by the collective agreement or regulatory act of the employer, agreed with the elected body of the primary trade union organisation or other body authorised to represent the personnel (and in the absence of such bodies â€“ representatives elected and authorised by the personnel), but not less of the payment for the actual time worked based on the base salary (official salary) of the employee.
