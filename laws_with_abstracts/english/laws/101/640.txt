When a dispute over the amount that is due to the dismissed employee arises, the owner or their authorised body should pay the compensation specified in this Article when the dispute is resolved in favour of the employee. If the dispute is resolved partially in favour of the employee, the amount of compensation for the delay is determined by the authority deciding on the merits of the dispute.
