In case of dissolution of the land lease contract at the initiative of the lessee, the lessor has the right to receive lease payment six months before in case of agricultural land, and a year before in case of non-agricultural land, if during the specified period no proposals were received from other persons to conclude a lease contract for this land plot on the same provisions, except when the dissolution of the contract was due to non-performance or improper performance by the lessor of contractual obligations.
