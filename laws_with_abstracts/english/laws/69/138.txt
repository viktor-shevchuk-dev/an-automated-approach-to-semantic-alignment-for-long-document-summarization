If the period of the land lease contract, which does not contain provisions on its renewal, expired on the day or after the day of death of the lessor, the contract shall be renewed at the request of the lessee for the same period and with the same provisions until the state registration of a right of ownership of the heir to the land plot or the state registration of a right of ownership to this land plot under the court decision on recognition of the inheritance as escheat property. This request shall be submitted to the State Register of Proprietary Rights to Immovable Property within a month from the date when the lessee became aware of the death of the lessor. Since registration of the heir's ownership right to the land leased by the person administrating the inheritance, or state registration of ownership of such land by a court decision declaring the inheritance as escheat property, the lease contract shall be terminated, and state registration of termination of the right to lease shall be carried out concurrently with the state registration of the ownership right.
