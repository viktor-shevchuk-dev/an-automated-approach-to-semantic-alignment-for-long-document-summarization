1. Ability of a person to make and revoke a will, as well as the form of a will and the act of its revocation, are determined by the law of the state in which the testator had his domicile at the time of making the act or at the time of death. A will or an act of its revocation may not be declared null and void due to non-compliance with the form, if the latter meets the requirements of the law of the place of making a will or lex partiae, or the law of the testator's habitual place of residence at the time of making the act or at the time of death, as well as the law of the state in which the immovable property is located.
