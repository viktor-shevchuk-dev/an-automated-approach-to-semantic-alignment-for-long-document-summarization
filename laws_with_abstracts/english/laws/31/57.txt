Thinness of young (up to 5 years) vineyards, which were laid out and cared for entirely at public expense, caused by negligent care for them, shall be regarded as mismanagement of land, for which reason the perpetrators can be held administratively liable. If more than 60 per cent of vineyards are thinned, they shall be excluded from the state register, their passports shall be revoked and state funding for planting and care of vineyards shall be terminated.
