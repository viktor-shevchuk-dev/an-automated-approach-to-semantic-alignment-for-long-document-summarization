4. If during the court hearing a person alleges violence against him/her during the compulsory hospitalisation or, regardless of the presence of the person's statement, if his/her appearance, condition or other circumstances known to a judge give grounds for reasonable suspicion of violation of the law during compulsory hospitalisation, the judge shall be obliged to ensure an immediate forensic examination of the person and send a separate ruling to the relevant pre-trial investigation authority on the need to investigate the use of violence and take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the person according to the law.
