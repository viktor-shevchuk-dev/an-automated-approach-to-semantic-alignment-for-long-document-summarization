1. Reviewing judgments under cassation procedure, the cassation court within the scope of arguments and claims of the cassation appeal, which became the basis for the opening of cassation proceedings, shall verify whether the court of first instance or the appellate court have applied the substantive or procedure law correctly and neither can establish or (and) consider proven circumstances that were not established in the judgment or rejected by it, nor decide on the reliability or unreliability of a particular evidence, the superiority of some evidence over others.
