2. Refusal to recognise the circumstances shall be accepted by the court if the refusing party proves that it has recognised these circumstances as a result of a material error, deception, violence, threat or serious circumstance, or that the circumstances were recognised as a result of malicious agreement of its representative with the other party. The court shall issue a ruling on accepting the party's refusal to recognise the circumstances. If the court accepts the party's refusal to recognise the circumstances, they shall be proved in the general procedure.
