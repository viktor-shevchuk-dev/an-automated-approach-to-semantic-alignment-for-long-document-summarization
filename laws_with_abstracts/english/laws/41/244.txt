If a judge who is not a judge-rapporteur in a case from a panel of judges cannot continue to consider such a case, which may impede the consideration of a case within the time limits established by this Code, such a judge shall be replaced at the initiative of a judge-rapporteur by the Unified Judicial Information and Telecommunication System by one of the substitute judges.
