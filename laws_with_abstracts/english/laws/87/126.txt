In arbitration proceedings with a panel of arbitrators, any decision of the arbitration tribunal shall be made, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, by a majority of all its members. However, matters of procedure may be decided by a presiding arbitrator if so authorised by the parties or all members of the arbitration tribunal.
