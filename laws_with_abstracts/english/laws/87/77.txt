1. The arbitration tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction including any objections to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause that forms part of a contract shall be interpreted as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitration tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.
