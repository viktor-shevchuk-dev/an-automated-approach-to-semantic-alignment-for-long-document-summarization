Business practice, which significantly distorts or may significantly distort the economic behaviour of only an explicitly determined (separate) group of consumers who are especially exposed to such activity due to their mental or physical impairments, age or trust, if it was reasonably possible for a seller to predict their behaviour and features, must be assessed in terms of the average representative of such a group, as well as assuming that given the specified circumstances there is no option to make a conscious and competent choice, and the consumer makes a mistake when conducting a transaction in respect of material circumstances. The specified conditions shall not concern legitimate advertising, including the creation of statements or expressions, which may be taken literally.
