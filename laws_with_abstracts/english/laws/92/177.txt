The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine creates and maintains a register of institutions that carry out training, retraining and advanced training of vehicle drivers, and exercises government control over their compliance with the requirements of the legislation in this area. The main form of government control in the area of road safety over the activities of institutions regardless of their form of ownership and subordination is the state accreditation of the institution and certification of its teachers, which is carried out at least once every five years in the manner determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
