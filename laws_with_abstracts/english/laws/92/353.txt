The procedure for exercising departmental registration and keeping records of vehicles is determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Unified automated electronic record systems are created to keep departmental records of registered vehicles by the relevant authorities by which they were registered. Departmental record information on specified vehicles is an integral part of the Unified State Register. In case of any encumbrances, registration (re-registration) of vehicles is carried out subject to consent from the encumbrancer(s).
