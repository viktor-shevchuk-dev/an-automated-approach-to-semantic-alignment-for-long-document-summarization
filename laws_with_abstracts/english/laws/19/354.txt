The analysis of the use of traditional phosphate mineral fertilizers indicates that their effectiveness is low since plants absorb only a few per cent of phosphorus, and acid technology requires the highest possible content of phosphorus pentoxide using only rich ores and high-quality reagents. It is offered to implement a method for obtaining phosphorous mineral fertilizers (containing calcium, magnesium and silicon), which excludes the use of sulfuric acid and the formation of gypsum as production waste, by incomplete reduction of phosphates by coal when heated to 800–1200 °C directly from phosphorus-containing ores to solve these problems. Efficient ecological, rational complex processing of phosphorus-containing raw materials, the product of which is the melted water-insoluble phosphates, is achieved. This approach makes it possible to start the industrial development of numerous small phosphorite deposits, for which the initial capital may be small and thereby attract a larger circle of investors.
