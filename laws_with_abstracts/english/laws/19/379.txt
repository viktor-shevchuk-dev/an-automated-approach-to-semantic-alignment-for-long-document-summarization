Natural coloured stones (precious, semiprecious, and ornamental) can be one of the most profitable budget-filling minerals in market conditions. Certain types and deposits of this stone can make a significant profit with relatively little time and money spent on their exploration and development. Of all the types of natural coloured stones in Ukraine, amber is currently the most competitive. The sale of ready-made, highly artistic amber products can become a reliable source of replenishment of the state treasury with funds, including foreign currency.
