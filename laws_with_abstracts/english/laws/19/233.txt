Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of resources and reserves of zirconium and hafnium. In the central part of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and its slopes, complex deposits of zircon-ilmenite-rutile placers were discovered and explored to varying degrees in terrigenous deposits of the Sarmatian tier and Poltava Neogene suite (Malyshevske, Volchank, Voskresensk, Tarasivka, Krasnokutsk and others). Large deposits of complex rare metal and zirconium-rare earth ores (Mazurivka, Azovsk, Novopoltavsk) are located in the Pryazovia region. As a concomitant mineral, zirconium was found in fluorite-rare earth ores of Yastrebets deposit and at the beryllium Perzhansk deposit in the north-eastern part of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield.
