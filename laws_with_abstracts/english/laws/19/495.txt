As a maritime power, Ukraine conducts various geological surveys in the water area within the exclusive (maritime) economic zone of Ukraine. The strategy for developing geological exploration on the continental shelf of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov consists of conducting medium- and small-scale (respectively 1:200000 and 1:50000) geological mapping of the sea-floor. It is carried out to obtain comprehensive and graphically systematized geological (geological-geophysical) information necessary to create an appropriate basis that provides a solution to the problems of studying and developing the bottom of water areas (coastal zones), in particular rational use of nature, assessment of mineral resources, as well as all types of sea research, environmental protection, for underwater construction, including oil and gas pipelines, structures for exploration and production of hydrocarbons, geological study, forecast, search and extraction of minerals, for the needs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, the Administration State Border Service of Ukraine, etc.
