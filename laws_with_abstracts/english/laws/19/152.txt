On the territory of Ukraine, the deposits of both metals are represented by silicate ores of the ultrabasite residual soil and are concentrated in two areas: the Middle Pobuzhzhia (Kirovohrad oblast) and the Middle Prydniprovia (Dnipropetrovsk oblast). The remaining active nickel reserves in the Middle Pobuzhzhia amount to more than 60 thousand tons, which provides the Pobuzhzhia Nickel Plant with raw materials for 9-10 years. Several new deposits and promising areas with total prospective resources of 52 thousand tons were identified near the location of the above-mentioned plant.
