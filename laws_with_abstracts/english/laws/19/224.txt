On the Ukraine territory, several hundred points of rare-earth concentration have been identified on a scale ranging from deposits to ore occurrences that require assessment. Most of them are located within the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and in the surrounding areas. In general, this vast territory is the largest rare-earth metallogenic province in Europe with the manifestations of mineralisation of almost all known endogenous and exogenous rare-earth formations. Within this province, three areas of rare-earth mineralisation concentrations are considered, within which there are deposits and promising ore occurrences: South-Eastern, North-Western and Central. The state balance of mineral reserves includes Novopoltavka apatite-rare metal ore deposit (Zaporizhzhia oblast).
