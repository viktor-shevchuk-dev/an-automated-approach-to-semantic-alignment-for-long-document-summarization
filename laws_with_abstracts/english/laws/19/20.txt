Due to the lack of funds, the volume of geological exploration has decreased by 3–4 times. Since 1994, the increase in proven reserves of most strategic types of minerals does not compensate for their extraction. Further delay in taking effective measures will lead to a shortage of certain types of own mineral raw materials, decreasing the level of national interests protection. In addition to the traditional import of oil, gas, some non-ferrous and rare metals, coking coal, magnesite, hydrofluoric and feldspar, Ukraine already imports sulfur, which it exported annually in the amount of 1.5–2.9 million tons until 1992.
