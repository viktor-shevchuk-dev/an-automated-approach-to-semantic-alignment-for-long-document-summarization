The most thoroughly studied objects of the Pryazovia region have significant resources and reserves and favourable mining, geological and hydrogeological conditions for development. The deposits can be used profitably in case of integrated use of these reserves (zirconium, nepheline, feldspar). Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine extract tantalum and niobium at Malyshevske complex deposit in Dnipropetrovsk oblast.
