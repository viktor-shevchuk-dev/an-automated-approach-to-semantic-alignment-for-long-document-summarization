Both plants are provided with proven reserves of titanium ores for the long term. The shortage of ores with fresh ilmenite, from which it is possible to obtain high-quality and competitive pigments using the technology of existing sulfuric acid production facilities in the city of Sumy and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea is a problem. The reserves of such ores in Ukraine are mainly associated with the large Stremyhorod deposit, prepared for industrial development, and the smaller Fedorivka deposit. The operation of these deposits will make it possible to simultaneously obtain scarce apatite concentrate and rare earths in apatite concentrate, vanadium, and scandium in ilmenite.
