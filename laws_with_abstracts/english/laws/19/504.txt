It is planned to create and operate a monitoring geological laboratory in Kryvyi Rih Basin based on Kryvyi Rih ultra-deep (5,422 meters) well. The main task of this laboratory is to register and collect data on variations of different fields in the well in the range of 2800â€“5300 meters and around to obtain information about changes in the characteristics of the geological environment at different depths and over time, which will be taken into account during the design and construction of underground facilities for environmentally safe disposal of active industrial waste, as well as used in the case of solving other geological theoretical and practical problems.
