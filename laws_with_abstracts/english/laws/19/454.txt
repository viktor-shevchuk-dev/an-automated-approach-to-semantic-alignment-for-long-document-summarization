Despite the certain achievements in solving these problems and meeting the needs of the economy, as well as in ensuring environmental safety and the actual state of study, obtained mainly during the geological research of previously mapped areas on a scale of 1:200000 (GDP-200) and reflected on the maps included in the set of the State Geological Map of Ukraine on a scale of 1:200000 (State Geological Map of Ukraine-200), they do not fully meet the needs of today.Â  Currently, about 75 per cent of the territory of Ukraine is covered by the works related to the creation of State Geological Map-200 (from the preparatory period of GDP-200 to already issued sets of maps). In many ways, medium-scale maps do not meet modern requirements. In the European Union countries, geological content maps are issued on a scale of 1:50000 or larger. Taking into consideration this fact, the priority types of geological mapping of the territory of Ukraine are the following:
