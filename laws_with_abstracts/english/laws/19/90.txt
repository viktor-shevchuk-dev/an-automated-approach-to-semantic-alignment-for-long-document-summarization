The general condition of the uranium mineral resource base is assessed as satisfactory. It is based on large deposits in Kirovohrad ore region, with uranium ores considered ordinary and inferior in quality. The second place in terms of industrial significance is occupied by deposits in the coal-sand Paleogene deposits of the Dnipro Basin, suitable for mining by underground leaching at the site of their occurrence. Although individual deposits of this type are small in reserves, their total resources are significant.
