To study the prospects of potential ore-bearing structures and areas for certain types of minerals, assess their forecast resources and allocate areas (plots) that are promising for identifying deposits of these minerals, it is planned to conduct geological forecast mapping, the main volumes of which will be performed during the implementation of the second stage of the Programme.
