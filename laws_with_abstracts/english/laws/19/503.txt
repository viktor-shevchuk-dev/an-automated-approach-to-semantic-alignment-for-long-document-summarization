The last quarter of the XX century for many countries (Russia, USA, Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Sweden, Great Britain, China, etc.) was connected with implementing a new stage of Earth exploration â€“ continental drilling for scientific purposes. The results of continental drilling allowed us to take a new approach to solve fundamental problems of the evolution of the Earth's crust and certain practical issues of geomechanics and rocks temperature regime. After drilling is completed, all deep and ultra-deep wells are supposed to be converted into monitoring geological laboratories (landfills or geophysical observatories). These objects are unique artificial channels in the Earth's crust that carry diverse information for all branches of Earth science.
