The need to attract external sources to meet the economy's coal needs is due to insufficient volumes of its own coking coal extraction and high sulfur content in it and a shortage of gas group coal for the needs of Ukrainian thermal power plants. Russia (almost 97 per cent) and Kazakhstan are the main importers. Consumers of imported coking coal are enterprises of the metallurgical complex of Ukraine, power and thermal power plants and enterprises of other industries.
