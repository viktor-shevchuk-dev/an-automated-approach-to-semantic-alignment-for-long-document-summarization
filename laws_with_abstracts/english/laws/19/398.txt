This type of raw material belongs to Category D. Glauconite, a concomitant component of phosphorite ores, is an important natural adsorbent. Quartz-glauconite sands are a complex agronomic ore. Reclamation of soils contaminated with radionuclides is another significant ecological area of glauconite use.
