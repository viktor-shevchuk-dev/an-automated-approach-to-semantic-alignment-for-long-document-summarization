This type of raw material belongs to Category D. In Ukraine, for the first time in the world geological practice, rather large (up to 50 microns) phases of metallic rhenium or its natural intermetallic compounds were detected in ultrabasites of Kapitanivka group massifs. Rhenium is a scarce, scattered element with the smallest Clarke (7x10-8) of all platinoids and lanthanides. Rhenium was known only as an isomorphic impurity and was extracted from other minerals (primarily molybdenum) in industrial volumes. In some cases, rhenium forms its own minerals with no industrial value. Rhenium is the metal of the future. Its unique and not fully understood properties determine the main areas of rhenium use: radio electronics, electronic and electronic-vacuum industry; oil refining (production of high-octane gasoline); aircraft construction (significant increase in engine life); instrument engineering; —Åosmonautics; production of metal composites with unique physical and mechanical properties due to various percentages of rhenium impurities (for example, tungsten with 5, 20, 27 per cent of rhenium and molybdenum with 8, 20, 47 per cent of rhenium, as well as molybdenum-tungsten-rhenium alloys). Such alloys are high-tech (well welded, solid, while plastic, and therefore retain their properties and shape in extreme conditions of their operation (high and ultra-high temperatures, pressure), producing incandescent production filaments with extended service life, cathode heaters, thermocouples. The needs for rhenium are unlimited. Today, its use is carried out in the production volumes. According to experts, the need for rhenium will only grow over time.
