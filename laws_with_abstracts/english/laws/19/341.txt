This type of raw material belongs to Category D. According to the State Agency of Ukraine for State Corporate Rights and Property Management, the current demand of economic sectors for phosphorus raw materials is estimated at 2.3–2.8 million tons per year based on 100 per cent phosphorus oxide P2O5 (in terms of phosphorus oxide P2O5), that is, 6–7 million tons of conditioned apatite concentrate. Our own deposits can met only part of the phosphorous fertilizers need. The possibility of importing Kola apatite concentrate is sharply reduced due to developing the main reserves for open production. The issue of importing phosphorite concentrates from North Africa, and the Middle East requires some caution since phosphorites dominate in their ores with a high content of cadmium, uranium, thorium and other harmful components.
