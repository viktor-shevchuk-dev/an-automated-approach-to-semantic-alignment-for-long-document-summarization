Metallurgical enterprises of Ukraine use bentonite clays of Dashukivka section of Cherkasy deposit as forming materials (reserves for more than 100 years). Since alkaline earth varieties of bentonites that are not suitable for the production of iron ore clay balls have an advantage in Ukraine, Ukraine imports a certain amount of alkaline bentonites, mainly from Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan).
