On the Ukraine territory, barium sulphate deposits were found in the Carpathian folded region and the zone of articulation of the Donets basin with the Pryazovia part of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. Transcarpathian barium sulphate ores are contained in two deposits â€“ Berehove and Bihansk, but their estimated reserves are small. The presence of its own raw material base of barium sulphate ores has become particularly relevant in recent years due to the depletion of reserves of these ores in the deposits of Russia, from where Ukraine imported raw materials.
