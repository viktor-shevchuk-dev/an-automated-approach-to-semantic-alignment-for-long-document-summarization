This type of raw material belongs to Category C. The problem of meeting the domestic industry needs in its own aluminium raw materials is very urgent, despite its considerable resources in general on the territory of Ukraine. Raw materials for Mykolaiv Alumina Plant (enterprise capacity for alumina is about 1300 thousand tons) and Zaporizhzhia Aluminum Combine (capacity for alumina is 250 thousand tons, for primary aluminium – 100–110 thousand tons) are imported high-quality bauxite. According to preliminary technical and economic calculations, potential internal resources of aluminium-containing raw materials (ferruginous bauxite of Vysokopillia deposit in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, nepheline ores in the Pryazovia, Transcarpathian alunites, kaolin and others) are uncompetitive compared to imported raw materials. They cannot be cost-effectively processed at domestic enterprises using current technologies.
