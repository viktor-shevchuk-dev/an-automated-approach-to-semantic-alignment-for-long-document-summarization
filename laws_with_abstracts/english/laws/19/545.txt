During the first stage, it is planned to implement a set of priority organisational, legal and scientific and technical measures aimed at solving the most important problems of providing mining enterprises with mineral raw materials, forming an optimal distribution of tasks and programmes for the development and use of the mineral resource base for each of the four categories of minerals and for specific types of raw materials, as well as creating favourable conditions for attracting domestic and foreign investments to finance the geological study of subsurface resources.
