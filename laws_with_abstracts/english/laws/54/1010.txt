3. The relevant executive authority or local government within the scope of their powers during a month shall consider the application and give permission for the development of a land management project for the allocation of a land plot or provide a reasoned refusal to provide it. The grounds for the refusal to grant such a permit may be only the non-compliance of the land plot's location with the legal requirements, the duly adopted regulatory acts, master plans of settlements and other urban planning documentation, land management schemes and feasibility studies for the use and defence of administrative-territorial units, land management projects for landscaping of settlements, approved in the manner prescribed by the law.
