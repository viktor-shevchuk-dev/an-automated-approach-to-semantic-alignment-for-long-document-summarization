7. The relevant executive authority or local government transferring state-owned or municipal land plots into ownership according to powers specified in Article 122 of this Code shall consider the application within a month and give permission to develop a land engineering project for allotment of a land plot or give a reasoned refusal to provide it. The grounds for the refusal to grant such a permit may be only the non-compliance of the object's location with the legal requirements, the duly adopted regulatory acts, master plans of settlements and other urban planning documentation, land engineering schemes and feasibility studies for the use and defence of administrative-territorial units, land engineering projects for landscaping of settlements, approved in the manner prescribed by the law.
