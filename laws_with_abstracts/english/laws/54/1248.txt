If, after announcing the price offered by the auctioneer, several participants raise their number plates at the same time (acceptance of the price offer without a vote), the auctioneer shall announce a new price increased by the auction step, without announcing the participants' numbers until any of them announces their price or the auctioneer does not determine which of the participants raised the plate first during the next increase in the price announced by the auctioneer.
