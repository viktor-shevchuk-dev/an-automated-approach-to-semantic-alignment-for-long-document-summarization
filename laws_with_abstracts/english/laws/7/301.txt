The power of attorney authorising to participate and to vote at the general meeting may contain the tasks of voting (a list of items on the agenda of the general meeting, indicating how and for which (against which) the representative must vote). When voting at the general meeting, the representative must vote strictly as specified in the task of voting. If the power of attorney does not contain a task of voting, the representative shall decide all matters concerning voting at the general meeting of his/her choice, taking into account the interests of the person he/she represents.
