The participants of a corporate fund shall not be liable for the obligations of the corporate fund and shall be exposed to the risk of losses related to the corporate fund’s activities only within the limits of their shares therein, but for the participants of the corporate funds, whose assets comprise above 10 per cent of the bank’s shares or above 50 per cent of the corporate rights of a person holding a substantial interest in the bank, which are then liable to the obligations of the bank under the law. The participants of a corporate fund may not be subject to any sanctions restricting their rights in the event of unlawful acts by a corporate fund or other participants of a corporate fund other than participants in corporate funds, whose assets comprise above 10 per cent of the shares of the bank or above 50 per cent of the corporate rights of the person holding a substantial interest in the bank, which may be sanctioned under the law governing the activities of banks, as a result of unlawful actions by an asset management company that manages the shares of a bank on behalf of such a corporate fund.
