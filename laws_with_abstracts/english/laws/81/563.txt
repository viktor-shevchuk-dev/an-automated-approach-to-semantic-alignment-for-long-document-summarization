Lessees to whom the water body has been leased are obliged to provide other water users with the possibility to carry out special water use in accordance with the procedure established by this Code, unless such special water use prevents the lessee from using the water body for the purposes specified in the lease contract. Water users who have been issued a special water use permit have the right to discharge return water into leased water bodies, given that the standards of maximum permissible discharge of pollutants are not exceeded.
