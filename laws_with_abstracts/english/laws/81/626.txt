In case of natural disasters, accidents, other extreme situations, as well as overspending of the established limit of water consumption by the water user, local councils are entitled to reduce or to prohibit the drinking water consumption for industrial needs from municipal water supply and temporarily limit its consumption from departmental economic and drinking water supply systems in favour of the priority satisfaction of drinking and economic and household needs of people.
