3. A carrier’s liability for the safety of cargo shall be terminated from the moment it is delivered to a consignee at the point of destination. Should a consignee fail to claim the cargo that has arrived within the established time limit or refused to accept it, a carrier shall be entitled to take the cargo for storage at the consignor’s expense and risk, notifying it in writing.
