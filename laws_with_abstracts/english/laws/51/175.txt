A grain storage facility shall be obliged to return the grain at the first request of the warehouse document holder, even if the storage period provided for by the warehouse storage agreement has not expired yet. In such a case, the warehouse document holder shall be obliged to reimburse the grain storage facility for the costs caused by the early termination of the obligation, unless otherwise provided for by the warehouse storage agreement.
