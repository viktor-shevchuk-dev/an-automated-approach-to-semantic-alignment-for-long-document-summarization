The lessor, within one month, reviews the notice letter sent by the lessee with the draft supplementary agreement, verifies it for compliance with the requirements of the law, agrees with the lessee (if necessary) the essential terms of the agreement and, if there are no objections, decides to renew the land lease contract (in relation to state and municipal land), enters into an additional agreement with the lessee on the renewal of the land lease contract. If the lessor has any objections regarding the renewal of the land lease contract, the lessee shall send a letter of notification on the decision adopted by the lessor.
