The consent shall not be treated as free if at the time of the marriage registration the relevant person had a severe mental disorder or was under the influence of alcohol, drugs or substances and was therefore not fully aware of the implications of their actions and/or was not able to control them, or if the marriage was registered as a result of physical or psychological violence.
