6. On the day when a sentence of community service or correctional labour expires or, in the case of release on other grounds, no later than on the next working day the relevant documents are received, the authorised probation authority shall send a notification to the court that ruled the sentence, as well as to the owner of the enterprise, institution, organisation or its authorised body, where the convict was serving their sentence, to terminate the community service or deductions from their wages. The convict may be issued a certificate of sentence completion or release from the sentence upon their request.
