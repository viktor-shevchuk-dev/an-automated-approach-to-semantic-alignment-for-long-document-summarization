16. Upon establishing that a person serving a sentence of imprisonment has violated the requirements of the regime, the facility administration shall be obliged to immediately initiate an investigation of the reasons, circumstances and motives for the violation, the personâ€™s behaviour before the misconduct, determine the number and nature of previously imposed penalties, and obtain their explanations about the misconduct on merits. Based on the results of the investigation, a decision shall be made as to whether it is appropriate or inappropriate to impose penalties on the convict serving a sentence of imprisonment and the type of penalty to be imposed. If the facility administration decides to limit itself to other preventive measures, the decision thereof shall be recorded in the journal of individual work with the convict and communicated to the convict against their signature.
