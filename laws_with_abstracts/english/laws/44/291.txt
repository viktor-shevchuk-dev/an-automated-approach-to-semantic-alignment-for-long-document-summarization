1. The period of a sentence of correctional labour shall be calculated in years, months and days during which a convict worked, and deductions were made from their earnings. The number of days worked by a convict shall be at least the number of business days for each month of the sentence imposed by the court. If a convict has not worked the specified number of days and there are no grounds established by this Code for counting the unworked days towards the period of a sentence, the serving of the sentence shall continue until the convict has fully worked the assigned number of business days. The beginning of the period of a sentence shall be the day on which the convictâ€™s earnings actually begin to be deducted.
