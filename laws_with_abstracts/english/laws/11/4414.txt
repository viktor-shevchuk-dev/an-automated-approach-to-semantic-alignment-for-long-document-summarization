4. A central authority of Ukraine shall have the right to refuse to send the request to a foreign state where circumstances referred to in this Code or the international treaty of Ukraine and which may preclude extradition, do exist. It shall also have the right to refuse to grant permission to the competent authority of Ukraine to apply to a foreign state, where the extradition would be obviously unjustified based on the correlation between the gravity of the criminal offence committed by the person, and the potential expenses required for the extradition.
