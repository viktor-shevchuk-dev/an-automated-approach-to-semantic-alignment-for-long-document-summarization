1. Before presenting an object for identification, investigator or public prosecutor or defence counsel first shall ask the identifying person whether he/she is able to identify this object, interview him/her about characteristic signs of this object, as well as about circumstances under which he/she saw this object, and draw up a record thereon. Where the person states that he/she is unable to list characteristic signs, which can help him/her identify the object but is able to identify it by totality of signs, the person who conducts procedural action shall enter this in the record. It shall be prohibited to show in advance to the identifying person the object to be presented for identification, and to provide other information on its characteristic signs.
