10. When deciding on asset forfeiture, the first issue to be decided on shall be returning money, valuables and other property to the owner (lawful holder) and/or compensation of damage inflicted through the criminal offence. Asset forfeiture shall be applied only after the prosecution proves through legal proceedings that the owner (lawful holder) of the money, valuables and other property was aware of their unlawful origin and/or use. Where a guilty person has no other property that can be recovered, other than the property liable for asset forfeiture, the damage inflicted upon the victim and civil plaintiff shall be paid from the proceeds of the forfeit sold, with the remaining part becoming the state property.
