3. Where a public prosecutor who performs duties of a prosecutor in certain criminal proceedings is unable to perform them due to a motion on his challenge, serious disease, dismissal from prosecutor’s office or another valid reason rendering his participation in the criminal proceeding impossible, the powers of prosecutor shall be vested in another prosecutor by the chief officer of a respective prosecutor’s office. In exceptional cases, the chief officer of a respective prosecutor’s office may vest these powers in another prosecutor from this same prosecutor’s office due to ineffective supervision over the compliance of pre-trial investigation with law by this public prosecutor.
