1. Before presenting an individual for identification, investigator or public prosecutor in advance shall find out if the identifying person can identify this individual, ask him/her about outward appearance and characteristic signs of this individual, as well as about circumstances under which the identifying person saw this individual, and draw up a record thereon. Where the person states that he/she is unable to list characteristic signs, which can help him to identify the individual but is able to identify him by the totality of signs, the record shall state by the totality of which signs he can identify the individual concerned. It shall be prohibited to show in advance to the identifying person the individual signs to be presented for identification and provide other information on characteristic signs of this individual.
