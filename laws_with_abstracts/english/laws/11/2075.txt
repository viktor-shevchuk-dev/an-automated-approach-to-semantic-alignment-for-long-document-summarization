3. The investigator or public prosecutor shall have the right, before the investigating judgeâ€™s ruling, to enter home or any other possession of a person only in urgent circumstances related to saving human life and property or in a hot pursuit of persons suspected of committing a crime. In such a case, the public prosecutor or investigator, with approval of the public prosecutor, shall be required to file promptly after such actions a motion with the investigating judge for a search warrant. The investigating judge shall consider such motion under the rules of Article 234 of this Code, having verified inter alia whether there did exist grounds for entering home or other possession of the person without a ruling of the investigating judge. Where the public prosecutor refuses to approve the motion for search or the investigating judge dismisses the motion for search, evidence found as a result of such search shall be inadmissible and any information so obtained shall be subject to destruction as provided for by Article 255 of this Code.
