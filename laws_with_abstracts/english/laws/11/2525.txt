10. The parties to the criminal proceedings, the victim and the representative of legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken shall be afforded time sufficient for examining the records to which they have been granted access. In case of delay in viewing the records to which access has been granted, the investigating judge upon a motion of a party to criminal proceedings, with due account of the scope, complexity of the materials and of conditions of access thereto, shall be required to set a time limit for viewing the materials, upon expiry of which the party to criminal proceedings, the victim or representative of legal entity in whose respect proceedings are taken shall be deemed as such who exercised their right of access to the materials. The motion shall be considered by the investigating judge of the local court, within the territorial jurisdiction of which the pre-trial investigation is conducted, and in criminal proceedings concerning criminal offences within the jurisdiction of the High Anti-Corruption Court it shall be considered by the investigating judge of the High Anti-Corruption Court no later than five days from the date of its receipt in court with notification of the parties to the criminal proceedings. Failure of the persons who had been appropriately notified of the date and time of the court session shall not impede consideration of the motion.
