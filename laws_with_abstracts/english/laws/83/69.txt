If there are sufficient grounds to believe that a vessel sailing in the exclusive (maritime) economic zone of Ukraine has violated the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine or of the international law on the marine pollution preventions, specially authorised bodies of Ukraine have the right to demand from such a vessel information that is necessary to establish whether a violation has been committed, and in case of refusal to give an explanation or if the received explanations contradict to the obvious facts to conduct an inspection of such a vessel.
