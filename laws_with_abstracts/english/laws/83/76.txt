If there are sufficient grounds to believe that any foreign vessel has violated the requirements of this Law or other relevant legislative acts of Ukraine and is trying to disappear, the right to chase it in order to detain the vessel and then hold the violator accountable is exercised in accordance with the procedure established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The chase must begin when the offending vessel or one of its boats is located within the exclusive (maritime) economic zone of Ukraine after the “Stop” signal had been issued and must stop as soon as the chased vessel entered the territorial waters of its state or any third party state.
