If the investor receives a refusal from the subsoil user to give consent for carrying out works within the mining allotment provided to such subsoil user for mining, except for mining allotments for the extraction of hard coal and lignite, anthracite and iron metal ores, regardless of the grounds for such refusal, such consent may be given by the specially authorised central executive authority for industrial safety, labour protection, state mining supervision and state regulation in the field of safe handling of industrial explosives, provided that the simultaneous use of subsoil by several subsoil users within one mining allotment will not endanger human life and health and will not harm subsoil and/or industrial facilities located within the specified allotment.
