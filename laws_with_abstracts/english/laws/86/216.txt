The amount of the fee for issuing special subsoil use permits shall be determined following the auction results. In case of granting a permit without holding an auction, a fee is charged, which is calculated based on the initial selling price of such a permit at auction. The initial selling price of the permit at the auction is calculated by the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, based on the value of reserves and resources of mineral deposits or subsoil areas following the methodology established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The initial selling price of a special permit for geological exploration of amber-bearing subsoil at the auction, including research and development of deposits with subsequent extraction of amber (industrial development of deposits) amounts to two thousand non-taxable minimum incomes per 1 hectare of the relevant ??amber-bearing subsoil area provided under the terms of economic risk (uneven occurrence of amber, lack of geological information and the impossibility of calculating the resources and reserves of minerals without prior exploration and/or mining operations in certain areas), with mandatory further approval of the reserves' evaluation in the manner prescribed by law.
