Aero thermal, hydrothermal or geothermal heat generated by heat pumps should be considered to be extracted from renewable energy sources, given that the final energy output significantly exceeds the initial consumption of energy required to actuate the heat pumps. In order to report to the Energy Community on the progress made in the promotion and use of energy from renewable sources, the share of energy produced by heat pumps shall be calculated under the methodology developed by the central executive authority shaping and implementing state policy in the field of energy conservation, renewable energy sources and alternative fuels.
