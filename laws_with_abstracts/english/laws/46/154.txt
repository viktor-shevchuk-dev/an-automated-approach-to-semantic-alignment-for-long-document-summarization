for electric power facilities or their construction stages (start-up complexes) producing electricity from other types of alternative energy sources (except for wind energy, solar energy, blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used), the size of such share may not be less than 10 per cent.
