Transit of cargos can take place in direct or mixed (combined) traffic. In direct traffic, the transit of cargos involves their carriage by one mode of transport without transhipment to another. In mixed traffic, the transit of cargos may involve their transhipment from one mode of transport to another, processing, segregating, packing, measuring, accumulating, forming or splitting consignments of cargos in transit, temporary storage, etc. Such operations are carried out in customs control zones exclusively at the option of the cargo owner (its authorised representative).
