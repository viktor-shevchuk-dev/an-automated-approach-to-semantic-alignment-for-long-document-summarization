9. Unresolved court cases by a reasoned order of the chief of the court's staff attached to a case file shall be transferred for automated re-distribution of cases only if a judge (if a case is considered alone) or a judge-rapporteur from the panel of judges (if a case is considered by the panel of judges) in cases provided for by the law may not continue the consideration of a case for more than fourteen days, which may impede the consideration of a case within the time limits established by this Code.
