A guilty verdict approved by the court of first instance may be withdrawn in order to apply a law on a graver criminal offence or a heavier punishment, cancel the wrongful relief of the accused from serving the sentence, increase the amount to be collected, or in other cases when it aggravates the condition of the accused â€“ only when the appeal for these reasons was filed by the prosecutor, the injured person or their representative. An innocent verdict approved by the court of first instance may be withdrawn only if the appeal was filed by the prosecutor, the injured person or their representative, or on the basis of the appeal of the accused or his defense attorney, for motives and reasons of exoneration (Article 421 of the Code).
