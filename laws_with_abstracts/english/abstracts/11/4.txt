In the course of criminal proceedings, no one may be kept in custody, detained or otherwise restricted in their right to free movement on suspicion or charge of a criminal offence, except on the grounds and according to the procedure provided for by the Code. Every person detained on suspicion or charge of a criminal offence, or otherwise deprived of freedom, must be promptly delivered to the investigating magistrate to determine the lawfulness and feasibility of their detainment, other deprivation of freedom and further custody. If the detained person is not presented with a motivated court resolution on detention in custody within seventy-two hours after their detainment, they are released immediately. Immediate notification of the person’s detention, taking into custody or other limitation of the right to free movement must be given to the immediate relatives, family members or other persons indicated by the detainee, according to the procedure envisaged by the Code. Anyone kept in custody or otherwise deprived of freedom during a term that exceeds the term envisaged by the Code must be released immediately. Detaining, taking into custody or otherwise limiting a person’s right to free movement during criminal proceedings, if done with no grounds or with violation of the procedure envisaged by the Code, entails liability according to law (Article 12 of the Code).
