According to Article 17 of the Code, a person is considered innocent of the criminal offence and may not be subjected to criminal punishment until their guilt is proven according to the procedure determined by the Code, and established by a guilty verdict that has taken effect. No one is obligated to prove their innocence of a criminal offence, and must be declared not guilty if the prosecution side fails to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion and accusation may not be based on evidence acquired by illegal means. Any doubts as to the standard of proof of a personâ€™s guilt are interpreted in favor of such person. In the course of criminal proceedings, a person whose fault has not been established by a guilty verdict that has taken effect must be treated the same as an innocent person.
