If necessary, the method, terms and procedure for enforcing a court resolution may be determined in the resolution. A court resolution that has become effective or is enforceable immediately is subject to unconditional enforcement. An innocent verdict or a court resolution that frees the accused from custody is carried out in this part immediately after being announced in the court room (Article 534 of the Code).
