According to Article 46 of the Code, a defense lawyer has no right to undertake defending another person or provide legal aid to another person, if this is in conflict with the interests of the person they are or were earlier providing legal aid. The defense lawyer’s failure to arrive for participation in any specific procedural activity, if the defense lawyer was given advance notice of such activity, and provided that the suspect or accused does not object to carrying out the procedural activity in absence of the defense lawyer, does not constitute grounds to deem such procedural activity invalid, except for cases when the presence of a defense lawyer is mandatory. No more than five defense lawyers of one accused may be taking part in the court hearing at the same time. A defense lawyer has the right to participate in questioning and other procedural activities that involve the suspect or accused; to have a confidential meeting with the suspect or accused before the first questioning, without requesting permission of the investigator, prosecutor or judge; and to have the same type of meetings after the first questioning, with no limitation of the number and duration of such meetings. Such meetings may be visually monitored by an authorized official, but the conditions must exclude the possibility of listening in or tapping. Documents related to the performance of the defense lawyer’s duties are not subject to inspection, seizure or disclosure by the investigator, prosecutor, investigating magistrate or the court, without consent of the defense lawyer. Bodies of state power and bodies of local self-government, as well as their officials, must fulfill lawful requests of a defense lawyer.
