According to Article 424 of the Code, the cassation procedure can be used to contest verdicts and rulings to apply or refuse to apply compulsory medical treatment or measures of educational influence made by the court of first instance, after they were reviewed under the appeal procedure; as well to contest resolutions of the court of appeal made in respect of the above court resolutions of the court of first instance. After being reviewed under the appeal procedure, rulings of the court of first instance and rulings of the court of appeal can be contested under the cassation procedure, if they interfere with further criminal proceedings. Objections to other rulings can be included into the cassation appeal against the court resolution made based on the results of the appeal proceedings.
