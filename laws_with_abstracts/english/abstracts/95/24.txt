Medical employees are obligated to provide first emergency aid in cases of accidents and acute diseases. Medical aid is provided by the ambulance service or by the nearest treatment and prophylactic institution, regardless of their departmental subordination and form of ownership, with subsequent compensation of expenses. In urgent cases, when providing medical aid is impossible due to the absence of medical employees at the site, enterprises, institutions, organizations and citizens are obligated to provide vehicles in order to transport the patient to a treatment and prophylactic institution. In such cases, first emergency aid shall also be provided by employees of the militia, fire fighting services, emergency services, drivers and representatives of other professions charged with this obligation by the legislation and their official instructions. Providing free aid to citizens in emergency situations (natural disasters, catastrophes, accidents, mass poisoning, epidemics, epizootics, radiation, bacteriological, chemical pollution, etc.) is an obligation primarily of specialized emergency medical aid alerted crews, with full compensation of the necessary expenses of the local health care institutions at the expense of centralized funds (Article 37 of the Fundamentals).
