Article 34 of the Fundamentals envisages that an attending physician can be selected directly by the patient or appointed by the head of the health care institution or its division. The obligations of the attending physician are timely and qualified examination and treatment of the patient. The patient has the right to demand a different physician. The physician has the right to refuse to continue being the attending physician of the patient, if the latter fails to observe the medical instructions or the internal regulations of the health care institutions, provided that this will not endanger the life of the patient and the public health. The physician is not responsible for the patient's health in case the latter refuses to observe the medical instructions or violates the regime established for them.
