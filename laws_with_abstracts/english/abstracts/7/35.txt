The estimated value of a security of a collective investment institution is determined by dividing the total value of net assets of the collective investment institution by the number of securities of the collective investment institution traded as of the day of estimate. The offering memorandum for securities of a collective investment institution may set a premium (during sale of securities of a collective investment institution) or discount (during buyout of securities of a collective investment institution) on the estimated value of a security of a collective investment institution that are included into assets of such institution (during sale of securities of a collective investment institution) or retained in assets of such institution (during buyout of securities of a collective investment institution). The above discounts cannot be applied during settlement of accounts with participants in case of liquidation of the collective investment institution. The maximum amount of premiums (discounts) is established by the Commission (Article 56 of the Law).
