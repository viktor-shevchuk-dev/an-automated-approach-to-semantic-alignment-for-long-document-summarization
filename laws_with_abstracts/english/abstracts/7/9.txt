A corporate fund is a legal entity that is created in the form of a joint stock company and carries out only collective investment activity. A corporate fund does not bear the liabilities of its participants. In case of any offences committed by corporate fund participants, no restrictive sanctions may be applied against the corporate fund and its bodies. Participants of a corporate fund do not bear the liabilities of the corporate fund, and bear the risk of losses related to the activity of the corporate fund only within the limits of the corporate fund shares owned by them. No restrictive sanctions may be applied against the participants of a corporate fund in case of any offences committed by the corporate fund or its other participants.
