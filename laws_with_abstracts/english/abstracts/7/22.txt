A share fund is the sum of assets that are owned by the participants of such fund on joint partial ownership rights, managed by an asset management company, and booked by it separately from its business results. The minimum amount of share fund assets is 1,250 monthly minimal wages, as established by law as of the day of the corporate fund registration as a collective investment institution. A share fund is not a legal entity and cannot have officials (Article 41 of the Law).
