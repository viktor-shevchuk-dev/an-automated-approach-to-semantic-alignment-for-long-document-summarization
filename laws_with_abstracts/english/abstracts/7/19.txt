Liquidation for the above reasons is done by decision of the general meeting of the corporate fund participants. In case no such decision is made by them, liquidation is done by court ruling, in particular, by application of the Commission or another authorized state body. If no decision to liquidate the corporate fund is made by the general meeting of the corporate fund participants within one month after the term provided for by the charter and regulations of a fixed-term corporate fund, the fund is liquidated by decision of the supervisory board. A fixed-term corporate fund can be liquidated before the time established by its regulations, by consent of all its participants. After a decision to liquidate a corporate fund is made, placement and trade of the fundâ€™s shares is forbidden.
