Securities of a collective investment institution can only be registered securities. Shares of a corporate fund are exclusively common shares, existing in the non-documentary form. Investment certificates exist exclusively in the non-documentary form. Securities of a collective investment institution are issued by public or private placement. Payment for securities of a collective investment institution is done exclusively with monetary funds, except for cases when payment for securities of an exchange-traded collective investment institution sold or bought back by the issuer is done with an appropriate portion of assets determined by the investment declaration of such institution. Payment for securities of a collective investment institution by installment is not allowed. Each security of a collective investment institution grants its owner the same amount of rights as to the owners of other securities of the same institution. No dividends are accrued or paid on securities of open and interval type collective investment institutes (Article 51 of the Law).
