The fare policy in the area of municipal electric transport shall be based on the principles of providing accessible and affordable transport services and creating the conditions for providing regular and safe passenger transportations. Rates for fare in transport shall be established with due consideration for the need to ensure break-even operation of carriers and to provide protection for poor and impoverished citizens. In case of establishing the level of fare that does not cover the expenditures related to passenger transportation, losses of the carrier shall be compensated by the authorized body that approves fare at the expense of funds from the relevant budgets.
