A charitable donation is a free transfer of funds, other property or property rights by the benefactor to the beneficiary for the purpose of achieving specific objectives of charitable work determined according to the Law. A charitable grant is a special-purpose assistance in the form of currency assets, which must be used by the beneficiary during the term determined by the benefactor. A charitable donation may be granted to beneficiaries determined through a competition, by the benefactor or his authorized persons. The terms of the competition may determine the actions that the beneficiary must carry out in favor of third persons, except those affiliated with the benefactor. The purpose and procedure for using the charitable donation may be changed by consent of the benefactor or his successors, as well by a court ruling, or in other cases provided for by law or the legal relations of the benefactor. The benefactor or his authorized persons have the right to control the purpose-oriented utilization of the charitable donation, including in favor of third persons (Article 6 of the Law).
