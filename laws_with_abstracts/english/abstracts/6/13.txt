The decision to liquidate a charity organization is made by the management body authorized by the constituent documents of the charity organization. The bases for a court decision to liquidate a charity organization are determined by the law. Assets remaining after liquidation of a charity organization and satisfaction of all creditor demands may be transferred to one or several charity organizations according to the procedure established by the constituent documents, or by decision of a court (Article 18 of the Law).
