Article 24 of the Law establishes that educational activity in the sphere of higher education is conducted by higher educational institutions and academic institutions (to prepare specialists with a doctor of philosophy degree) on the basis of licenses issued by the central executive authority in the sphere of education and science, according to the procedure established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine according to the Law. In order to procure a license for education activity, an applicant submits a written application and an expert opinion of the National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance to the central executive authority in the sphere of education and science. Based on the received documents, the central executive authority in the sphere of education and science, within 10 working days, issues the appropriate higher educational institution with a license to conduct education activity, or denies such license. The decision to deny the license must be substantiated and contain references to specific provisions of the education activity standard that the applicant fails to conform to. Licenses are issued separately for each specialty, for a term of 10 years, and can only be annulled for reasons provided for by the Law. Information about license issue and annulment is entered into the Single State Electronic Database in the Issues of Education.
