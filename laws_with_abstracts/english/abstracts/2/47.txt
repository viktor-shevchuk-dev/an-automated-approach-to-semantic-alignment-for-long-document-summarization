Article 35 of the Law envisages that a faculty is managed by a dean (supervisor), and an educational and academic institute, by a director (supervisor), who can hold these positions for a maximum of two terms. The dean (supervisor) and the director (supervisor) of an educational and academic institute can delegate part of their authority to their deputies. The authority of a head of faculty (educational and academic institute) is determined by a provision on faculty (provision on educational and academic institute), approved by the academic council of the higher educational institution. A military department in a higher educational institution and a faculty (department) of a higher military educational institution (higher educational institution with specific education conditions) is managed by the head, appointed on a competitive basis. The procedure for the competition is determined by normative legal acts of the state authority whose sphere of management includes the higher military educational institution (higher educational institution with specific education conditions) or the military department of a higher educational institution, by approval with the central executive authority in the sphere of education and science. A department is managed by the department head (supervisor), who can hold this position for a maximum of two terms.
