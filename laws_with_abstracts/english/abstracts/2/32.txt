A higher educational institution is created in the form of a state-owned, municipal-owned, or privately-owned institution and operates on non-profit principles. A legal entity (except an academic institution) receives a higher educational institution status when it receives a license for education activity. A higher educational institution can be the founder (co-founder) of other legal entities whose activity conforms to the directions of education, academic, production, and innovative activity of the higher educational institution, and/or provide for the execution of its statutory tasks. State-owned, municipal-owned, or privately-owned higher educational institutions have equal rights to carry out education activity, academic activity and other forms of activity. Higher educational institutions can conduct education activity jointly with foreign educational institutions, under approved education programs. Higher educational institutions can create educational, educational and academic, and educational, academic and production complexes, science parks, and be part of a consortium. All participants of a complex or a consortium retain their legal entity status and financial independence. A higher educational institution acts on the basis of its own statute (Article 27 of the Law).
