The legal forms and the procedure for using lands within the boundaries of industrial parks are determined in Article 11 of the Law. Within an industrial park, land plots can be used by industrial park members according to legal forms provided for by the Land Code of Ukraine. The managing company that acquired the lease right for the industrial park lands according to the procedure established by the law, grants tenure and use (sub-lease) of land plots to the industrial park members, with development rights, according to the land legislation of Ukraine. If two or more potential industrial park members are interested in the same land plot within the boundaries of an industrial park, the managing company shall hold a competition to select one member, with regard to the industrial park concept. An undeveloped land plot from state or municipal ownership is granted to the managing company under a lease, according to the procedure established by the legislation. If an industrial park is being created on privately owned lands, the rights to land plots can be granted to the industrial park members by the park initiator according to the forms and procedures established by the legislation. If a lessee of a land plot initiates creation of an industrial park, this land plot or parts of it are granted to the industrial park members directly, as a sub-lease, according to the land legislation of Ukraine. Land plots are granted to industrial park members to construct and maintain real estate required for business activity. Proceeds from sale of state and municipal owned land plots on the territory of an industrial park are included in appropriate budgets, according to the procedure envisaged by the Budget Code of Ukraine and the Law on the State Budget of Ukraine for the respective year.
