In case of mass arrival of people to the territory of Ukraine from a country that shares a border with Ukraine, due to external aggression, foreign occupation, civil war, conflicts on the grounds of ethnicity, natural or man-made emergencies, or other events that disrupt public order in a certain part or entire territory of their country of origin, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, by recommendation of the specially authorized central body of executive power in the issues of migration, passes a resolution to grant asylum to such arrivals. The issue of receiving people in need of asylum, determining places for their accommodation, the procedure of their registration and ensuring their livelihood, and the financing, are regulated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Asylum is granted to people by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine until the cessation of circumstances in their country of origin that have forced them to arrive to the territory of Ukraine, but for a term that does not exceed one year. The duration of asylum can be extended, but for a term that does not exceed one year. A migration service body issues each person of age that is part of the people who have been granted asylum with an identity certificate of a person who has been granted asylum in Ukraine (Article 18 of the Law).
