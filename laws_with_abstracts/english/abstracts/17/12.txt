The rights and obligations of refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection are envisaged by Chapter III of the Law. In particular, Article 14 of the Law envisages that persons who have been granted the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection exercise the same rights and liberties and are bound by the same obligations as the citizens of Ukraine, except for cases established by the Constitution and the Laws of Ukraine, as well as international agreements declared binding by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Persons who have been granted refugee status in Ukraine are considered to be permanent residents of Ukraine from the day of the decision to grant them refugee status. Persons who have been granted the status of a person in need of subsidiary protection are considered to be staying on the territory of Ukraine indefinitely on legal grounds.
