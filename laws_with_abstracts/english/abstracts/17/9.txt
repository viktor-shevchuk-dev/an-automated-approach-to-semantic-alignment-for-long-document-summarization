The decision on the application to be granted the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection is made by the specially authorized central body of executive power in the issues of migration within one month of receiving the personal file of the applicant and the written statement of the migration service body that reviewed the application. The decision term can be extended by the head of the specially authorized central body of executive power in the issues of migration, but only insofar that the total term of review does not exceed three months. Based on the results of comprehensive analysis and evaluation of all documents and materials that may constitute proof of conditions for granting the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection, the specially authorized central body of executive power in the issues of migration reaches a decision to grant the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection, or to refuse granting the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection. A foreigner or a stateless person are granted the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection in Ukraine and considered permanent residents of Ukraine from the moment of the decision to grant them refugee status, or on a legal indefinite stay on the territory of Ukraine (Article 10 of the Law).
