The state retains the property right for the leased objects of the fuel and energy complex, including those that were reconstructed or re-equipped by the lessees at the expense of depreciation deductions. The amount of depreciation deductions by which the lease payment was decreased is used to finance work aimed at improving the lease object, carried out by the lessee according to the procedure and terms determined by the lease agreement, as agreed on with the lessor. The lessee of the object of the fuel and energy complex has the right to reconstruct, re-equip and improve the leased property at their own expense. Any improvement of the leased object of the fuel and energy complex that cannot be separated from the leased object without damaging the latter may only be introduced by the lessee by consent of the lessor and the authorized management body (Article 13 of the Law).
