Customs duty rates, except for seasonal special duties, are established exclusively by laws of Ukraine in the issues of taxation. Import duties for goods subject to customs clearance according to the procedure established for companies are accrued according to rates established by the Customs Tariff of Ukraine. Import duty is differentiated for goods originating from states that are part of the same customs union as Ukraine or create free trade areas together with Ukraine. If any special preferential customs regime is established according to international agreements ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, preferential import duties established by the Customs Tariff of Ukraine are used. Goods originating from Ukraine, member states of the World Trade Organization, or states with which Ukraine concluded bilateral or regional agreements on most favored nation treatment, are subject to reduced import duty rates established by the Customs Tariff of Ukraine, unless otherwise provided for by law. Other goods are subject to full import duty rates established by the Customs Tariff of Ukraine.
