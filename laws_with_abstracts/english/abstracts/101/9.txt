Duration of working time of the employees in Ukraine shall not exceed 40 hours per week. Simultaneously, for some categories of the employees a reduced working time is determined - 36 or 24 hours per week. The Code also defines duration of work at night and grants the possibility to the employee to work part-time (half-time working day or half-time working week).
