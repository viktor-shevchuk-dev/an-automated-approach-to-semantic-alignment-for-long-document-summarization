The same shall apply to legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who conduct (conducted) their economic activities within the territory of localities defined in the list approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine where the anti-terrorist operation was conducted. Banks and other financial institutions, as well as creditors, are obliged to cancel the penalties and/or fines accrued on the principal amount of debt under credit agreements and loan agreements during the period of the anti-terrorist operation for persons specified in this Article. Provisions of parts one and two of this Article shall not apply to the accrual of penalties and/or fines on the principal amount of debt under credit agreements and loan agreements concluded with legal entities and individual entrepreneurs located within the territory of anti-terrorist operation, except for localities from the lists provided for in part four of Article 4 of this Law, if such agreements are concluded after 1 January 2018 or to which, by agreement of the parties, changes were made after 1 January 2018 to extend the term for the fulfilment of obligations and/or reduce the amount of interest or punitive sanctions. For temporarily displaced higher education institutions and temporarily displaced scientific institutions to fulfil credit and other contractual obligations (except for agreements on the provision of educational services) that arose before moving to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian authorities in connection with the anti-terrorist operation, a moratorium is introduced for the period of the anti-terrorist operation. For the duration of the anti-terrorist operation, it is prohibited to charge penalties and/or fines on the principal amount of debt owed by temporarily displaced higher education institutions and temporarily displaced scientific institutions under credit and other agreements (except for agreements on the provision of educational services) that have not ceased, starting from the date of publication of the order to change their location by the central executive authority in the field of education and science.

Sanctions can be applied on behalf of Ukraine against a foreign state, foreign legal entity, legal entity controlled by a foreign legal entity or a non-resident natural person, foreigners, stateless persons, and terrorist entities. Application of sanctions does not exclude application of other measures to protect the national interests, national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, its economic independence, and the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of citizens of Ukraine, the society and the state.  \n",
