Authorities in charge of public administration in the field of subsoil geological study, use and protection Public administration in the field of geological study, use and protection of subsoil shall be carried out by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the central executive authority ensuring the formation of state policy in the field of environmental protection, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of labour protection, the government authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, local executive authorities, other government authorities and local governments under the legislation of Ukraine. Types of subsoil use The subsoil is provided for use for the purpose of: the geological study, including an experimental programme of mineral deposits of national importance; mining; construction and operation of underground structures not related to mining, including constructions for underground storage of oil, gas and other substances and materials, disposal of harmful substances and production waste, wastewater discharge; creation of geological territories and objects of important scientific, cultural, sanitary and health-improving value (scientific landfills, geological preserves, reserves, natural monuments, medical, sanitary institutions, etc. Requirements for geological study of subsoil During the geological study of the subsoil, the following shall be ensured: 1) rational and effective works related to the geological study of subsoil; 2) state of the environment ecologically safe for human life and health; 3) comprehensive study of the subsoil geological structure, mining and engineering, hydrogeological and other conditions of development of explored deposits, construction and operation of underground structures not related to mining; 4) reliability of determining the quantity and quality of reserves of all minerals and their components, geological and economic assessment of mineral deposits; 5) conducting works by methods and in the manner that would exclude unjustified losses of minerals, reduction of their quality, excessive destruction of soil cover and environmental pollution; 6) placement of extracted rocks and minerals, which would exclude their harmful effects on the environment and public health; 7) preservation of exploration mine openings and wells that can be used for the development of deposits and other purposes, and the elimination of openings and wells not suitable for further use in the prescribed manner; 8) preservation of geological and mechanical completion documentation, samples of rocks and ores, duplicate samples of minerals that can be used in further study of subsoil, exploration and development of mineral deposits, as well as in the use of subsoil for purposes not related to mining. Main requirements for the design, construction and commissioning of mining facilities, mineral processing facilities, as well as underground structures not related to mining Mining construction plans shall provide for: 1) the location of ground and underground structures, ensuring the most rational and efficient use of mineral reserves; 2) methods of prospecting, systems of mineral deposits development and technical schemes of processing (preparation) of mineral raw materials that provide the most complete, comprehensive and economically feasible extraction of mineral reserves, as well as the use of existing components; 3) rational use of the overburden in the development of mineral deposits; 4) warehousing, storage and determination of the procedure for accounting of minerals that are temporarily not used, as well as production waste containing useful components; 5) geological study of subsoil discovered in the process of construction and mining facilities operation, and preparation of geological and surveying documentation; 6) reclamation of disturbed lands, maximum preservation of soil cover; 7) measures to ensure the safety of people, property and the environment. Powers of the state geological control authority related to control over the geological study of subsoil State geological control authority verifies: 1) compliance with the requirements for the subsoil protection during the conduct of works on its study; 2) implementation of national programmes of geological exploration works, geological tasks and orders; 3) feasibility of applying methods and technologies, quality, integrity, the efficiency of works on the geological study of subsoil; 4) implementation of decisions on methodological support of works on the geological study and use of subsoil; 5) compliance with regulations, rules and other requirements for the geological study and use of subsoil, conditions of special permits for subsoil use and subsoil use agreements; 6) completeness of the subsoil geological structure study, mining and engineering, engineering and geological, geological and ecological and other conditions for the study of mineral deposits; 7) compliance of geological exploration works and scientific research with state contracts and orders, as well as projects for conducting such works; 8) use of technical means and methods of conducting works on the subsoil geological study, which prevent unjustified losses of minerals and deterioration of their quality; 9) timeliness and compliance with the established requirements for the commissioning of explored mineral deposits; 10) technology compliance during research and industrial operation of mineral deposits that ensure their studying without reducing the industrial value; 11) preservation of exploration mine openings and wells for the development of mineral deposits, storage of geological documentation, rock samples, duplicate samples that can be used in the further study of the subsoil; 12) justification of search, exploration areas and other works on the geological study of subsoil; 13) timeliness and correctness of state registration of works on geological study and use of subsoil, availability of special permits for subsoil use and fulfilment of conditions stipulated thereby; 14) completeness and reliability of initial data on the quantity and quality of reserves of basic and coexisting minerals, components contained in them, as well as the provision of performance balances of mineral reserves to enterprises and organisations; 15) accounting for oil, gas and related components; 16) conducting exploration and other works on the geological study of groundwater.
