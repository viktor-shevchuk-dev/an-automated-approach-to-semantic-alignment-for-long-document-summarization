State regulation of safety in the field of radioactive waste management The following types of activity are subject to state regulation of safety in the field of radioactive waste management: Keeping state records of radioactive waste, the State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories, places of its disposal, as well as places of its temporary storage; Design and survey work on selecting sites for the placement of facilities intended for radioactive waste management; Design, testing, manufacture or construction of facilities and vehicles intended for radioactive waste management; Commissioning, operation, decommissioning of facilities intended for radioactive waste management, shutting down of storage sites for disposal and carrying out routine work to ensure the safety of storage sites for disposal after their shut-down; Transportation and storage of radioactive waste. The central government executive authority in the field of radioactive waste management is entrusted with the following functions: Development and implementation of a uniform technical policy in the field of radioactive waste management in Ukraine; Implementation of the National Targeted Environmental Programme for Radioactive Waste Management; Co-ordination of works on the collection, processing, transportation, storage and disposal of radioactive waste of industry, nuclear energy, medicine, research institutions and radioactive waste generated during the liquidation of the Chornobyl disaster; Organisation of the activity of specialised enterprises on radioactive waste management; Creation and ensuring the functioning of the state record-keeping system of radioactive waste; Co-ordination of works on construction, operation, reconstruction, decommissioning of facilities intended for radioactive waste management, and shutting down storage sites for disposal; Co-ordination of works on creation of new repositories of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; Co-ordination of research and development work in the field of radioactive waste management; Development of the procedure for creation and use of the money of the State Fund for Radioactive Waste Management; Organising the activities to determine, create and maintain continuous operation of the radioactive waste physical protection system, as well as control over its support during the collection, processing, transportation, storage and disposal. Licensees who perform work at any stage of radioactive waste management shall: Ensure safety during the design, site selection, construction, operation and decommissioning of structures and equipment intended for radioactive waste management; Re-assess the safety of existing facilities intended for radioactive waste management in a timely manner, so that all practically available improvements are made, if necessary, in order to enhance the safety of such facilities; Ensure the development and implementation of quality programmes for the safety of radioactive waste management; Keep own records of radioactive waste; Provide physical protection of radioactive waste; Provide radiation monitoring of places for storage or disposal of radioactive waste; Inform state executive authorities and local governments in a timely manner about violations in the operation of facilities intended for radioactive waste management; Take measures to eliminate radiation accidents and their consequences; Be able to indemnify for losses from radiation accidents during radioactive waste management at their own expense or at the expense of insurance companies.
