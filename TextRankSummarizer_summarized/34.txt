Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: released energy – electric or heating energy supplied to consumers from a co-generation unit; additional fuel – fuel that is burned permanently or temporarily in the combustion products of the main fuel to increase the electric and/or heating capacity of the co-generation unit; efficiency of using additional fuel – the ratio of the increase in the amount of released energy (electrical and/or heat energy) supplied by the co-generation unit during the year, due to the combustion of additional fuel during the specified period, to the energy of such additional fuel; qualification of a co-generation unit – determination by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving that the conditions and indicators of the co-generation unit operation meet the requirements (qualification indicators) of this Law; qualified co-generation unit – a co-generation unit, the conditions and performance of which meet the requirements of this Law; co-generation unit – a set of equipment that works by the method of combined production of electric and heating energy or converts the discharge energy potential of technological processes into electric and heating energy; combined production of electric and heating energy (co-generation) – a method of simultaneous production of electric and heating energy within one technological process as a result of fuel combustion; main fuel – fuel that ensures the efficiency of the co-generation unit, including the discharge energy potential of technological processes; the discharge energy potential of technological processes – secondary energy resources that can be used to produce electric and heating energy in co-generation units. Features of the use and operation of co-generation units The use of co-generation units has its specifics due to the following factors: the consumption of traditional organic fuels or use of the waste energy potential of technological processes; the possibility of using additional fuel; the possibility of supplying electricity from the co-generation unit to the local electricity grid or consuming it for the own needs of the facility where the co-generation unit is used; the diversity of energy facilities where co-generation units are built; the presence of significantly different requirements for the ratio of electric and heating energy produced by the co-generation unit. Principles of the public policy on the use of co-generation units The public policy on the use of co-generation units is based on the principles of: development and balanced use of co-generation units in the national economy; facilitating the restructuring of existing heat generation facilities into combined electric and heating energy units to increase fuel efficiency and environmental safety; creating distributed (local) electricity generation capacity as a condition for improving the reliability and safety of energy supply at the regional level; government regulation of relations in this area; economic incentives for the use of co-generation units in enterprises, irrespective of their form of ownership or sectoral affiliation; ensuring free access of government regulatory authorities to information on the condition of co-generation units and volumes of electric and heating energy production. Government regulation in the field of the use of co-generation units is carried out by: the qualification of co-generation units; licensing economic activities for combined heating and electric energy production; setting tariffs for heat produced by co-generation units; supervising and monitoring the safe execution of work in the construction or reconstruction of co-generation units. If the combustion of additional fuel is used to maintain the design electric capacity of the co-generation unit while temporarily reducing the thermal capacity of the waste energy potential in relation to its implication adopted in the technical design of the co-generation unit, the amount of additional fuel consumption must be approved by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving; 2) traditional (organic) fuel is used as the main fuel, and the amount of supplied heat shall be at least 10 per cent of the total electric and heating energy production within one year of its commissioning and within each subsequent 12-month period; during the said period, the amount of supplied electric and heating energy in relation to the main and additional fuel energy shall be at least 42 per cent. Section V INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE USE OF CO-GENERATION UNITS Article 14. International cooperation in the use of co-generation units Ukraine participates in international co-operation in co-generation and the use of secondary energy resources according to Ukrainian legislation and international agreements of Ukraine. 30, Article 283): Article 3 shall be supplemented with clause “i” that reads as follows: “i) stimulating the rational use of fuel and energy resources through combined electric and heating energy production (co-generation);” clause “b” of part one, Article 17 shall be supplemented with the words “for their consumption in excess of the specific consumption rates defined by the system of standards, and prior to the introduction of the system of standards, the norms of specific consumption of energy resources, as well as for non-compliance of co-generation units with the qualification rates.” 3.
