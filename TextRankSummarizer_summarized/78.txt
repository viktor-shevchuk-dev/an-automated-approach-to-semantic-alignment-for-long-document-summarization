Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: main pipeline — a technological complex which functions as an integrated system and which consists of the separate pipeline with all facilities and structures connected to it within a joint technological process, or a number of pipelines which perform transit, interstate, interregional deliveries of transported products to consumers, or other pipelines designed and constructed according to the state construction requirements for the main pipelines; industrial pipelines (connected networks) — all other non-main pipelines laid at production facilities, as well as at oil and gas storage facilities, intra-facility oil, gas and product pipelines, urban gas, water, heat, sewer distribution networks, water supply distribution pipelines, land reclamation systems, etc; technical corridor — a land lot within boundaries of which had been laid a system of pipelines and communications; executive survey — placement of the facility on a land use plan and on other cartographic sources; flaw detection of the internal cavity of the pipeline — process of determining, recording or transmitting of geometric, physical and other parameters of the pipeline and its anti-corrosion coating, which defines its technical reliability, using a set of sensor placed inside the pipeline; diagnostics — a set of technical measures to determine the technical parameters of the pipeline; pipeline transport infrastructure — main and industrial pipelines, including ground surface, above ground and under ground linear parts of pipelines, as well as facilities and structures, main and auxiliary equipment that ensure safe and reliable operation of pipeline transport; protected area — land strips along main and industrial pipelines, around industrial facilities that ensure normal operating conditions, prevent damage, as well as aimed to reduce negative impact on people, adjacent land lots, nature sites and environment in general. Subjects to the legal regulation of relations in the field of pipeline transport Subjects to the legal regulation of relations in the field of pipeline transport are legal entities and individuals that are directly involved in: defence of the state; research, exploration, design, consulting and other engineering works and services in this field; construction, installation, specialized installation, repair, setting up, commissioning works and services in this field; operation of pipelines; manufacturing and supply of construction and structural materials, equipment, machines, mechanisms, sensors and other types of equipment for enterprises, their associations and organizations that are related to design, construction, configuration and operation of pipeline transport infrastructure; ensuring safety of personnel and population and also of environment during the phases of construction, operation, overhaul and reconstruction of the pipeline transport infrastructure; ensuring security on the pipeline transport; foreign economic activities in the field of pipeline transport; state oversight and control over construction and operation of the pipeline transport infrastructure Article 6. Relations of pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations with local state executive authorities, representative bodies and local self-government bodies, enterprises, institutions and organizations Local bodies of state executive power, representative bodies and local self-government bodies within the limits of their powers: approve locations for structures and other pipeline transport facilities on land lots allocated for use by pipeline transport enterprises in accordance with the Land Code of Ukraine; take measures to ensure safety of operation of pipeline transport facilities by enterprises, institutions and organizations; participate in preparing and coordinating plans for protection of personnel and population, in joint measures on performing works during a state of emergency; notify and inform the public about protection measures and rules of conduct during a state of emergency, as well as during the operation of pipeline transport facilities and involve specialists of pipeline transport enterprises to such activities; accept Executive survey materials from enterprises, institutions and organizations of pipeline transport and provide them to other enterprises, institutions and organizations in accordance with the procedure approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Rights and obligations of pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations Pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations have right: to monitor the performance of works defined by the Rules of security measures for main pipelines approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; to submit motions against design organizations to be accountable for erroneous design decisions in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation of Ukraine; for priority provision of material and technical resources in the required volumes, assortment and of proper nomenclature at their request through the state procurement system; for power supply of pipeline transport facilities at first category rated network's reliability; to demand from construction enterprises to perform pre-start diagnostics, flaw detection of the internal cavity of the pipeline and executive survey; to establish special units by booking personnel from the pipeline operation support and maintenance services to increase its reliability and technical coverage during the special period. Pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organizations must ensure: supply to customers of hydrocarbons, chemical products, water and other products and substances according to contracts; adhering to current safety and technical operations norms and rules, to rules of fire safety and environmental protection; that infrastructure, built (reconstructed) is commissionned for operations without violation of norms and rules; diagnostic monitoring of pipeline conditions with functional tools and in accordance with the rules of technical operation and the legislation acts on diagnostics; technical re-certification of pipeline transport infrastructure after it reached operational lifetime limit and in case of premature aging, fatigue, partial loss of reliability or safety; conservation of pipelines, if for any reason they don't function for more than one year, ensuring constant technical oversight over pipeline in order to support operability; transfer of the executive survey information, prepared in a duly manner by construction organisations and by customer to the local state executive authorities and to the local self-government bodies in order to place that information at the district land use maps, that in a duly manner provide information about location of pipelines to relevant enterprises, institutions and organisations. Enterprises, institutions and organisations, and also citizens that discovered damages to the pipeline or leakage (spill) of transported product, must immediately inform enterprise that is operating such a pipeline or local state executive authorities or representative bodies or local self-government bodies; Pipeline transport enterprises, institutions and organisations, together with local state executive authorities or representative bodies or local self-government bodies at the territories where pipelines are located, together with the bodies authorized by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, other interested enterprises and organisations must develop joint action plan for ensuring accident free operation of pipeline transport and performance of works in a state of emergency, and such measures must be approved by the territorial headquarters of the Civil Defence of Ukraine. Persons become liable for violation of the legislation on pipeline transport if they are guilty of: failure to adhere to the requirements of the Rules of security measures for main pipelines; intentional damage, destruction and stealing of pipeline transport infrastructure equipment, stealing of products transported by the pipeline transport and also damage to environment; allowing use of defected construction and structural materials, fit-out equipment for the pipeline transport infrastructure; creating obstacles for performance of works (measures), related to prevention and recovery from disaster aftermaths, accidents and catastrophes by state executive authorities, enterprises, institutions and organizations, and also by individual citizens; violation of safety rules by the pipeline transport enterprises, including environmental safety rules; failure to adhere to the directives and prescriptions issued by state control and oversight authorities; failure to execute approved cooperation plans while performing works in a state of emergency.
