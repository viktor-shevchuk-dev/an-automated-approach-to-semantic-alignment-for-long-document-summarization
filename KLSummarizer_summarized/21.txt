Business entities that produce, supply and transport thermal energy and hold a monopoly (dominant) position in the thermal energy market may not cease their activities or reduce the supply of thermal energy in order to create a shortage of thermal energy unless the need for such a restriction is established by the Ukrainian legislation. The heat-transporting entity shall have no right to deny the consumer of thermal energy in providing him with thermal energy in case of availability of technical possibilities for connection of the consumer to the heating network. General Principles for the Formation of Thermal Energy Tariffs Tariffs for thermal energy must ensure recovery of all economically justified costs for the production, transportation and supply of thermal energy. Tariffs for thermal energy sold by business entities that have a monopoly position in the market shall be regulated. In case of the absence of established tariffs for a business entity for transportation and supply of thermal energy produced using natural gas, for the needs of the relevant category of consumers, tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy shall be determined at the level of weighted average tariffs for transportation and supply of thermal energy. Tariff for thermal energy for the consumer shall be defined as the sum of the tariffs for production, transportation and supply of thermal energy. Tariffs for thermal energy produced and supplied by autonomous heating systems shall be formed and set separately for each apartment building equipped with an autonomous heating system, taking into account the cost of production and supply of thermal energy in such systems, as well as the profitability of the business entity conducting such activities.
