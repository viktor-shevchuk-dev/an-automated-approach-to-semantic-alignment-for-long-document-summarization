In case of dissolution of the land lease contract at the initiative of the lessee, the lessor has the right to receive lease payment six months before in case of agricultural land, and a year before in case of non-agricultural land, if during the specified period no proposals were received from other persons to conclude a lease contract for this land plot on the same provisions, except when the dissolution of the contract was due to non-performance or improper performance by the lessor of contractual obligations. Lessee's pre-emptive right to conclude the land lease contract for a new period After the period of the land lease has expired, the lessee who duly complied with the obligations under the provisions of the contract shall have a pre-emptive right over other persons to enter into the land lease contract for a new period. The lessee who intends to exercise the pre-emptive right to enter into the land lease contract for a new term, shall notify the lessor before the expiration of the land lease contract within the period established by this contract, but not later than one month before the expiration of the land lease contract.
