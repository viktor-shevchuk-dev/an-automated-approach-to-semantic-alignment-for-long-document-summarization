State, targeted, interstate and regional programmes of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources shall be developed based on the data obtained from state water accounting, water cadastre, schemes of use and protection of waters and reproduction of water resources taking into account river basin management plans. The authorities exercising public control in the field of use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources Public administration in the field of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources shall be carried out with account for basin principle based on state, targeted, interstate and regional programmes of use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources, as well as river basin management plans. The central executive authority, in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of environmental protection, central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management development, the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of protection and rational use of water and reproduction of water resources, and other authorities in accordance with the legislation are the executive authorities in the field of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources. The basin council is formed by the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of water management development to develop proposals and provide coordination of the interests of enterprises, institutions and organisations in the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources within the basin. The competence of the central executive authority in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection, management and control over the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources The competence of the central executive authority in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection, management and control over the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources includes: 1) enforcing the formation of state policy in the field of protection and reproduction of waters (surface, subsoil, marine), rational use of water resources; 3) development of state targeted, interstate programmes of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources; 5) development and approval of standards and rules for regulating the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources within the scope of its competence; 10) implementation of international cooperation on the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources; 10-1) approval of the boundaries of river basins, sub-basins and water management zones; 10-2) approval of the procedure for the development of water management balances; 10-3) allocation of sub-basins and water management areas within the river basins; 10-4) approval of the standard regulations on basin councils; 10-5) approval of the method for ranging a surface water mass in one of the classes of ecological and chemical states of the surface water mass, as well as assigning an artificial or significantly modified surface water mass to one of the classes of ecological potential of an artificial or significantly modified surface water mass; 10-6) approval of the method for ranging the subsoil water mass in one of the classes of quantitative and chemical states of the subsoil water mass; 10-7) approval of the list of pollutants to determine the chemical state of surface and subsoil water mass and the ecological potential of artificial or significantly altered surface water mass; 10-8) approval of the methodology for determining the surface and subsoil water mass; 11) solving other issues in the field of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources. The competence of the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of protection and rational use of water and reproduction of water resources, in the field of management and control over the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources The competence of the central executive authority implementing the state policy on state supervision (control) in the field of protection and rational use of water and reproduction of water resources, in the field of management and control over the use and protection of water and reproduction of water resources includes: 1) implementation of state supervision (control) over compliance with the requirements of the legislation on protection and rational use of water and reproduction of water resources; 2) making a decision on the restriction, temporary ban (suspension) of activity of enterprises, institutions, organisations and facilities in case of violating the requirements of water legislation by them; 3) solving other issues in the field of water use and protection and reproduction of water resources. State accounting of subsoil waters State accounting of subsoil waters shall be carried out by the central executive authority implementing the state policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, by observing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of subsoil waters according to the programme approved by the central executive authority in charge of shaping the state policy in the field of environmental protection.
