involved by business entities or state supervision (oversight) bodies during the implementation of state supervision (oversight) measures. If the business entity is built into an implementation plan of state supervision (oversight) simultaneously by several state supervision (oversight) authorities for the relevant planning period, the corresponding planning measures shall be conducted by state supervision (oversight) authorities combined â€” simultaneously by all the state supervision (oversight) authorities, whose plans to conduct state supervision (oversight) measures include a business entity. Conduct of state supervision (oversight) measures by various state supervision (oversight) authorities on the same issue shall be prohibited. Plans for the implementation of state supervision (oversight) measures for the next planning period must contain the starting dates of each state supervision (oversight) measure planned and a period for their implementation. Inclusion of the same business entity in the plans for the state supervision (oversight) measures implemented by the various state supervision (oversight) authorities shall be the basis for conducting a comprehensive planned state supervision (oversight) exercise with respect to such business entity. State supervision (oversight) authorities shall conduct planned state supervision (oversight) given that a business entity shall be notified in writing of the planned measure no later than in 10 days before the day on which the measure shall be conducted. If the criteria for distribution of business entities by level of their business risk, the frequency of the planned measures, as well as the list of issues for their implementation are not set, such business entities shall be considered as business entities with insignificant degree of risk and shall subject to state supervision (oversight) not more than once every five years.
