Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: released energy – electric or heating energy supplied to consumers from a co-generation unit; additional fuel – fuel that is burned permanently or temporarily in the combustion products of the main fuel to increase the electric and/or heating capacity of the co-generation unit; efficiency of using additional fuel – the ratio of the increase in the amount of released energy (electrical and/or heat energy) supplied by the co-generation unit during the year, due to the combustion of additional fuel during the specified period, to the energy of such additional fuel; qualification of a co-generation unit – determination by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving that the conditions and indicators of the co-generation unit operation meet the requirements (qualification indicators) of this Law; qualified co-generation unit – a co-generation unit, the conditions and performance of which meet the requirements of this Law; co-generation unit – a set of equipment that works by the method of combined production of electric and heating energy or converts the discharge energy potential of technological processes into electric and heating energy; combined production of electric and heating energy (co-generation) – a method of simultaneous production of electric and heating energy within one technological process as a result of fuel combustion; main fuel – fuel that ensures the efficiency of the co-generation unit, including the discharge energy potential of technological processes; the discharge energy potential of technological processes – secondary energy resources that can be used to produce electric and heating energy in co-generation units. The list of these secondary energy resources is established by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving. Features of the use and operation of co-generation units The use of co-generation units has its specifics due to the following factors: the consumption of traditional organic fuels or use of the waste energy potential of technological processes; the possibility of using additional fuel; the possibility of supplying electricity from the co-generation unit to the local electricity grid or consuming it for the own needs of the facility where the co-generation unit is used; the diversity of energy facilities where co-generation units are built; the presence of significantly different requirements for the ratio of electric and heating energy produced by the co-generation unit. Co-generation in municipal heat supply The conditions for the management of municipal heat supply companies, as defined by the regulations, are maintained in the case of modernisation of these companies through the use of co-generation units and apply to economic entities that provide heat to the population and social facilities from separately constructed co-generation units. Qualification of co-generation units Co-generation units that supply part or all of the electricity produced to consumers other than their own consumption needs may be recognised as qualified if they meet the qualifying indicators of one of these two conditions: 1) as the main fuel, the waste energy potential of processes is used; heat production is not compulsory for these units. If the combustion of additional fuel is used to maintain the design electric capacity of the co-generation unit while temporarily reducing the thermal capacity of the waste energy potential in relation to its implication adopted in the technical design of the co-generation unit, the amount of additional fuel consumption must be approved by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving; 2) traditional (organic) fuel is used as the main fuel, and the amount of supplied heat shall be at least 10 per cent of the total electric and heating energy production within one year of its commissioning and within each subsequent 12-month period; during the said period, the amount of supplied electric and heating energy in relation to the main and additional fuel energy shall be at least 42 per cent. Rules for connecting co-generation units to the heat grid are set by the central executive authority in the field of heat supply.
