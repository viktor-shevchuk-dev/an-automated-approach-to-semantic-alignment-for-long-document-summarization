Laws on Transit of Cargos Laws on the transit of cargos consist of this Law, the Customs Code of Ukraine, international treaties of Ukraine and other regulatory acts on cargo transit. Freedom of Cargo Transit Freedom of cargo transit shall be ensured by: absence of any discrimination against parties to transit operation, cargos in transit on the grounds of their place of origin, departure, entry, exit or destination, or due to circumstances relating to the ownership of cargos or transit means of transport, the place of registration or flag of the latter, and in the taxation of cargo transit operations, except for an adequate response to discriminatory measures against Ukraine or economic sanctions of international organisations supported by Ukraine; free choice by parties to transit operation of transit services, works (except in cases determined by laws and international treaties of Ukraine), their providers (performers), means of transit, and transit routes; absence of unreasonable delays and restrictions, including in relation to means of transit, and exemption from payment of any other charges except the single duty levied at checkpoints on the state border of Ukraine. In direct traffic, the transit of cargos involves their carriage by one mode of transport without transhipment to another. In mixed traffic, the transit of cargos may involve their transhipment from one mode of transport to another, processing, segregating, packing, measuring, accumulating, forming or splitting consignments of cargos in transit, temporary storage, etc. Transit of cargos in direct traffic involves their carriage under a single transport document along the entire route. Cargos in Transit Cargos in transit are dry bulk, liquid bulk, solid bulk, break-bulk, general cargo, and cargo-luggage accepted for carriage under an agreement (contract). The main tasks of coordination include: ensuring interaction between parties to transit operation for the purpose of cargo transit continuity and elimination of downtimes and delays of transit means of transport; ensuring high quality of transit services (works); developing and implementing measures aimed at bringing national transit services (works) in line with international standards.
