Core principles of state policy in the field of radioactive waste management The core principles of state policy in the field of radioactive waste management are the following: Priority of protecting the life and health of personnel, the population and the environment from the impact of radioactive waste in accordance with state radiation safety standards; Delimitating functions of state control and management in the field of radioactive waste management; Implementing the state policy in the field of radioactive waste management by means of the development and fulfilment of a long-term National Targeted Environmental Programme for Radioactive Waste Management; Ensuring the minimum level of the radioactive waste generation that can be achieved in practice; Preventing the uncontrolled accumulation of radioactive waste; Ensuring state supervision over the radioactive waste management; Making decisions on the location of new radioactive waste repositories with the participation of citizens, their associations, as well as local executive authorities and local governments; Ensuring reliable isolation of radioactive waste from the environment when substantiating the safety of radioactive waste repositories; Storing radioactive waste with waste producers for a limited time with subsequent transfer to specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management; Responsibility of radioactive waste producers for safety during radioactive waste management before their transfer to specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management; Prohibiting legal entities and individuals, who supply and use radioactive substances to nuclear installations from performing any burial of radioactive waste generated as a result of their activity; International co-operation in the field of radioactive waste management; Active research activities in the field of radioactive waste management. Responsibilities of legal entities and individuals during radioactive waste management The right to radioactive waste management is given to legal entities and individuals who have a duly issued permit of the state regulatory body for nuclear and radiation safety to carry out the relevant type of activity (the licensees). Specialised enterprises for radioactive waste management enter into relevant agreements with local executive authorities and local governments. State Register of Radioactive Waste The creation of the State Register of Radioactive Waste and the organisation of its record-keeping is entrusted to the state administration body in the field of radioactive waste management. The creation of the State Cadastre of Radioactive Waste Repositories and organisation of its record-keeping is entrusted to the state administration body in the field of radioactive waste management. Control over the state of the environment in the areas of the location of radioactive waste repositories is carried out at the expense of the licensee of radioactive waste repositories. Shutting down (mothballing) of radioactive waste repositories Shutting down (mothballing) of radioactive waste repositories is carried out by the decision of the state administration body in the field of radioactive waste management, agreed with the body of state regulation of nuclear and radiation safety.
