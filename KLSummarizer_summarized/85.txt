The jurisdiction of a commercial case, in which one of the parties is a commercial court or a judge of a commercial court, to which the case falls under the general rules, shall be determined by a decision of a court of higher instance delivered without notice to the parties. The protocol should contain the following information: 1) date, time of beginning and end of automated distribution; 2) number of a court case, category and coefficient of its complexity, name (title) of the parties to a case; 3) information on determining the list of judges to participate (grounds, on which judges do not participate) in the automated distribution; information on the appointment of a judge, a judge-rapporteur; 4) grounds for the implementation of automated distribution (automated re-distribution); 5) last name, initials and position of the authorised person of the court staff responsible for the implementation of automated distribution of court cases. If a case party or his/her representative has been duly notified of the hearing, the court shall hear the case in the absence of such a case party due to the following: 1) case party's non-appearance at the court hearing (his/her representative) without reasonable excuses or without communicating the reasons for non-appearance; 2) repeated non-appearance at the court hearing of the case party (their representative), regardless of the reasons for non-appearance; 3) non-appearance of the representative at the court hearing, if the person he/she represents or another his/her representative appeared at the court hearing; 4) non-appearance of the case party at the court hearing, if his/her representative appeared, except in cases when the court recognised the case party's appearance mandatory. A person who did not take part in the case, but in respect of whom the court has decided on their rights, interests and (or) obligations, may obtain in the court that considered the case as a court of first instance, a duplicate decision approved by the court of any instance, that is stored in the case files. The cases shall be considered in the court of appeal in a court hearing with the notification of the case parties, except as provided for in Part 10 of this Article and Part 2, Article 271 of this Code. A person who did not participate in the case, if the court has decided on their rights, interests and (or) obligations, shall have the right to file a cassation appeal against the judgment only after its review under appellate procedure upon his/her appeal, except in the case when the judgment on the rights, interests and (or) obligations of such a person has been adopted directly by the court of appeal. Judgments shall be subject to compulsory revocation with the referral of the case for reconsideration if: 1) the case has been considered and resolved by an unauthorised court; 2) the judge to whom the recusal was filed took part in the adoption of the judgment, and the court of cassation recognised the grounds for their recusal as substantiated, if the cassation appeal has been substantiated by such ground; 3) the judgment has not been signed by any of the judges or has not been signed by the judges specified in the judgment; 4) the judgment has been adopted by judges who were not members of the panel that considered the case; 5) the case has been considered in the absence of any of the case parties, not duly notified of the date, time and place of the court hearing, if such a case party substantiates his/her cassation appeal with such ground; 6) the judgment has been adopted in violation of the rules of instance or territorial jurisdiction; 8) the court has adopted a judgment regarding the rights, interests and (or) obligations of persons who were not involved in the case.
