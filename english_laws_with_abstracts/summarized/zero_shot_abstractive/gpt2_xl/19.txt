 (I am particularly concerned in this respect by the fact that the level of investment in mineral reserves of the country is at the lowest level in a generation. A very high level of mineral production is achieved by mining reserves which are considered of low quality. A very low level of extraction is linked with such a low level of  Since 2010, the Ukrainian Minerals Council has begun to produce an annual report that details the resources in Ukraine's mineral resources, including potential sources for new deposits of mineral raw materials; potential prospects for such resources; and the development of the process of extraction and mining, preparation of the sources, and further development of the processing  for example, in China about $1–1.5 billion worth of coal deposits will be released during the next 20 years.
According to the scientific assessments, the mineral deposits of Ukraine are very diversified, mainly belonging to the "silicized" and "eutectic" categories. The presence of  Category C represents raw materials of the most advanced stage of technological development. Such raw materials have sufficient proven reserves and are either highly developed or completely developed in large-scale production, and will be exclusively sold in international markets; Category D comprises the raw materials found nowhere or are not suitable for consumption in countries where it would be  IN THE CASE OF THE ENERGY REGION, WHICH BECOMES A REGION OF THE SOCIETY OF OBLIGEURE UNDER THE PRESENT ACT OF THE KINGDOM OF THE UKRAINE PRIME MINISTERIAL ORGAN, A.N. 328/2014, AS AM  The same regions contain 2,071.9 million tons of gas plus condensate (equivalent to 22 and 30 per cent, respectively).

Aluminium production is  Therefore, it is desirable to start research activities to create a new supply chain for this type of raw material.

The nickel mining of Ukraine is concentrated on the Donbas region and on the territory of Crimea. In the first half of the 21st century, the highest quantity of the nickel that could have been extracted in Ukraine were actually -lead ores are found in the Ukrainian territory as well as in the United States, but the potential of nickel deposits in this area is limited to the mining of nickel-cobalt ores.
