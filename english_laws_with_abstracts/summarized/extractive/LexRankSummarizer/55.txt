Special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Use of oil and gas potential subsoil, search and exploration of oil and gas fields, their operation, construction and operation of underground storage tanks for oil and gas shall be carried out only with special permits for use of oil and gas potential subsoil issued by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, under the conditions provided for by current legislation. Principles of issuing special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Issuance of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil shall be carried out in accordance with the principles of: openness of the tender system when selecting the winner of the tender for obtaining special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; the availability of appropriate qualifications of the applicant, logistical and financial capabilities for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; state warranties to owners of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and protection of their interests in accordance with the law throughout the validity of the special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; providing owners of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil commitments under current legislation and a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; ensuring the most efficient and rational use of oil and gas potential subsoil; payment for the issuance of special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; approval by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, of the terms of tenders for each site of oil and gas potential subsoil with local self-government authorities, and with the central government body, implementing public policy in industrial safety and state mining supervision on the use of oil and gas potential subsoil for commercial development; taking into account the results of environmental impact assessment in the case of oil and gas production (commercial field development). Procedure for issuing special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Special permits for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil shall be issued to auction winners, except in cases specified by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil. Suspension of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil The validity of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil can be temporarily suspended exclusively as a result of measures of state geological control by the central government body, implementing public policy in the field of geological study and rational use of subsoil, directly or at the request of the state mining and technical, environmental and sanitary control bodies and local self-government authorities in the case of: violation by the user of oil and gas potential subsoil or his/her authorised contractor of the special permit for use of oil and gas potential subsoil or agreements on the conditions of use of oil and gas potential subsoil; occurrence as a result of work, related to the use of oil and gas potential subsoil on the site, a direct threat to the life or health of employees of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil or the population; repeated violations of environmental legislation and rational use of oil and gas potential subsoil; performance of work on the site not specified in the special permit for use of oil and gas potential subsoil, except for search and exploration of new oil and gas deposits within the area. Revocation of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil Revocation of a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil shall be carried out in the case of: refusal of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil to use oil and gas potential subsoil; liquidation of a business entity that has been issued a special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil; withdrawal in the manner prescribed by law of the area of oil and gas potential subsoil provided for use; recognition of the issued special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil as invalid; suspension of the special permit for the use of oil and gas potential subsoil and failure of the user of oil and gas potential subsoil to take measures to eliminate the causes of this suspension; the user of oil and gas potential subsoil has not started using oil and gas subsoil within 180 calendar days from the date of validity of the special permit for the use of oil and gas subsoil without valid reasons; unintended use of oil and gas potential subsoil.
