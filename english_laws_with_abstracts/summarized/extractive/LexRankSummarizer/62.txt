Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: alternative types of fuel – solid, liquid and gas fuel which is an alternative to relevant traditional types of fuel and is produced (extracted) from non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials; wastes – slags and wastes from industry, agriculture, municipal and other enterprises that may be a source or raw material for the extraction or production of alternative types of fuel; non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials – raw materials of plant origin, wastes, solid fuels, other natural and artificial sources and types of energy raw materials including oil, gas, gas condensate and oil and gas condensate depleted, non-industrial and technogenic deposits, heavy grades of oil, natural bitumen, gas-saturated water, gas hydrates, etc., the production (extraction) and processing of which requires the use of new technologies and which are not used for production (extraction) of traditional types of fuel; consumers of alternative types of fuel – individuals and legal entities that use technical equipment, including internal combustion engines, boiler units, furnaces, other power generating units, systems and machines, that fully or partially operate on alternative types of fuel; field of alternative types of fuel – the field of activity related to the production (extraction), transportation, storage and consumption of alternative types of fuel; biological types of fuel (biofuel) – solid, liquid and gas fuel produced from biologically renewable raw materials (biomass) that may be used as fuel or a component of other types of fuel; biocomponent – biofuel used as a component of other types of fuel; biomass – a non-fossil biologically active renewable substance of organic origin, capable of biodegradation, in the form of products, wastes and residues of forestry and agriculture (crop production and livestock) fishery and industries technologically related to them as well as bidegradable component of industrial and domestic wastes; bioethanol – dehydrated ethyl alcohol made from biomass or raw ethyl alcohol to be used as biofuel; biobutanol – butil alcohol made from biomass used as biofuel or biocomponent; biodiesel fuel (biodiesel) – methyl and/or ethyl esters of higher organic acids obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats that are used as biofuel or biocomponent; biogas – gas obtained from biomass that is used as fuel; biohydrogen – hydrogen obtained from biomass; it is a type of biogas; biofuel producer – a business entity that directly produces biofuel from biomass; additives based on bioethanol – biocomponents of motor fuel obtained by means of synthesis using bioethanol or by mixing bioethanol with organic compounds and fuel obtained from raw hydrocarbons, the content of bioethanol in which fulfils the requirements of regulatory acts and which are categorised as biofuel; liquid fuel from biomass – diesel biofuel, bioethanol, biobutanol, pure oil and other synthetic fuels, made from biomass; synthetic biofuels – synthetic hydrocarbons and mixtures of synthetic hydrocarbons made from biomass. Producers of alternative fuel shall be considered to be business entities of all forms of ownership that produce solid, liquid and gas fuel from non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials. Features of relations in the field of production and use of biological types of fuel Activities in the field of production and use of biological types of fuel may be carried out by business entities of all forms of ownership in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine. Organisational and economic measures to stimulate production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel Organisational and economic measures to stimulate production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel shall include: determination of sources and directions for financing of measures in the field of alternative fuel; the use in the field of alternative types of fuel of economic levers and stimulus stipulated by legislation of Ukraine for enterprises, institutions, organisations and citizens whose activities are related to the development and introduction of low-waste, resource-saving, environmentally friendly technologies when using non-traditional and renewable sources and types of energy, including emissions, and discharges of pollutants into the environment during the production process of alternative types of fuel; providing legal entities and individuals with subsidies, grants, tax, credit and other benefits established by laws of Ukraine to stimulate development and introduction of new technologies, equipment, materials in the production (extraction) process of alternative types of fuel; stimulation of enterprises-manufacturers of machines, mechanisms, devices, energy systems, other technical equipment and appliances to them, working on alternative types of fuel as well as enterprises, institutions, organisations and citizens which re-equip technical equipment working on traditional types of fuel, in order to consume alternative types of fuel; stimulation of investment activities and introduction of new technologies in the field of alternative types of fuel by means of creation of a preferential investment regime and other economic activities by foreign investors; according to law, provision of special state guarantees to protect foreign investment directed to develop the field of alternative types of fuel; creation of special information fund to accumulate, systematise and disseminate information about the presence of non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials in Ukraine. VIOLATION OF LEGISLATION IN THE FIELD OF ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF FUEL Article 13. Offences in the field of alternative types of fuel Offences in the field of alternative type of fuel shall include: sale of alternative types of fuel that does not meet the requirements of regulatory acts by enterprises-manufacturers, legal entities, individuals; production, sale and consumption of traditional types of fuel as alternative ones; granting benefits to producers and consumers of alternative types of fuel, if their activities do not meet the requirements of the legislation on alternative types of fuel; non-execution of orders, instructions of the authorities implementing state supervision and control over observance of the current legislation on alternative types of fuel as well as creating obstacles for their activities; unreasonable refusal to provide relevant authorities with the necessary information about production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel. Other offences in the field of alternative types of fuel may be established by the laws of Ukraine.
