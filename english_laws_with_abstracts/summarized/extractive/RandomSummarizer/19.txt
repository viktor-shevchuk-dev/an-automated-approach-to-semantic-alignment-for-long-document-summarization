Today, Ukraine extracts considerable amounts of black coal (1.7 per cent of the total world extraction volume), commercial iron (4.5 per cent) and manganese ores (9 per cent), uranium, titanium, zirconium and graphite (4 per cent), kaolin (18 per cent), bromine, ochre, non-metallic metallurgic raw materials (native sulfur, rock salt and potassium salt), capstone (granites, gabbros and labradorites), glass-making sand, etc. The second place in terms of industrial significance is occupied by deposits in the coal-sand Paleogene deposits of the Dnipro Basin, suitable for mining by underground leaching at the site of their occurrence. At the same time, it was found that serpentinites are primarily high-quality magnesium ores both for the extraction of metallic magnesium (MgO – 97–98.8 per cent), suitable for the manufacture of high-quality periclase refractories, and magnesium oxide (magnesia). The possibility of importing Kola apatite concentrate is sharply reduced due to developing the main reserves for open production. remain relevant.
