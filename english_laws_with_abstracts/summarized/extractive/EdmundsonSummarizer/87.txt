LAW OF UKRAINE This Law is based on the recognition of the value of arbitration (arbitration tribunal) as a widely used method of settling disputes arising in international trade and the need for comprehensive regulation of international commercial arbitration by means of legislation; it takes into account the provisions on such arbitration contained in the international treaties of Ukraine as well as in the model law adopted in 1985 by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and approved by the UN General Assembly for its possible use by the states in their legislation. Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Scope of application 1. This Law applies to international commercial arbitration if the place of arbitration is located within the territory of Ukraine. However, the provisions of Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36 of this Law also apply in cases where the place of arbitration is abroad. 2. The Maritime Arbitration Commission at the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has its own seal reproducing its name in the Ukrainian and English languages and displaying an anchor and the scales of justice.
