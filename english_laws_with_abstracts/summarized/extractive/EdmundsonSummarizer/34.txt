LAW OF UKRAINE This Law defines the legal, economic and organisational basis for the activities of subjects of relations in the field of energy-saving regarding the use of co-generation units and regulates relations related to the specifics of production, transmission, distribution and supply of electric and heating energy from co-generation units. The purpose of this Law is to create a legal basis for increasing the efficiency of fuel use in energy production processes or other technological processes, developing and applying technologies for combined electric and heating energy, improving the reliability and security of energy supply at the regional level, and attracting investments for the establishment of co-generation units. Section I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: released energy – electric or heating energy supplied to consumers from a co-generation unit; additional fuel – fuel that is burned permanently or temporarily in the combustion products of the main fuel to increase the electric and/or heating capacity of the co-generation unit; efficiency of using additional fuel – the ratio of the increase in the amount of released energy (electrical and/or heat energy) supplied by the co-generation unit during the year, due to the combustion of additional fuel during the specified period, to the energy of such additional fuel; qualification of a co-generation unit – determination by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving that the conditions and indicators of the co-generation unit operation meet the requirements (qualification indicators) of this Law; qualified co-generation unit – a co-generation unit, the conditions and performance of which meet the requirements of this Law; co-generation unit – a set of equipment that works by the method of combined production of electric and heating energy or converts the discharge energy potential of technological processes into electric and heating energy; combined production of electric and heating energy (co-generation) – a method of simultaneous production of electric and heating energy within one technological process as a result of fuel combustion; main fuel – fuel that ensures the efficiency of the co-generation unit, including the discharge energy potential of technological processes; the discharge energy potential of technological processes – secondary energy resources that can be used to produce electric and heating energy in co-generation units. The list of these secondary energy resources is established by the central executive authority in the field of energy-saving. Article 2. 2509-IV
