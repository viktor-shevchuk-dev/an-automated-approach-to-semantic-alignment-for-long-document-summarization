Definitions For the purposes of this Law, the following definitions shall apply: alternative types of fuel – solid, liquid and gas fuel which is an alternative to relevant traditional types of fuel and is produced (extracted) from non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials; wastes – slags and wastes from industry, agriculture, municipal and other enterprises that may be a source or raw material for the extraction or production of alternative types of fuel; non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials – raw materials of plant origin, wastes, solid fuels, other natural and artificial sources and types of energy raw materials including oil, gas, gas condensate and oil and gas condensate depleted, non-industrial and technogenic deposits, heavy grades of oil, natural bitumen, gas-saturated water, gas hydrates, etc., the production (extraction) and processing of which requires the use of new technologies and which are not used for production (extraction) of traditional types of fuel; consumers of alternative types of fuel – individuals and legal entities that use technical equipment, including internal combustion engines, boiler units, furnaces, other power generating units, systems and machines, that fully or partially operate on alternative types of fuel; field of alternative types of fuel – the field of activity related to the production (extraction), transportation, storage and consumption of alternative types of fuel; biological types of fuel (biofuel) – solid, liquid and gas fuel produced from biologically renewable raw materials (biomass) that may be used as fuel or a component of other types of fuel; biocomponent – biofuel used as a component of other types of fuel; biomass – a non-fossil biologically active renewable substance of organic origin, capable of biodegradation, in the form of products, wastes and residues of forestry and agriculture (crop production and livestock) fishery and industries technologically related to them as well as bidegradable component of industrial and domestic wastes; bioethanol – dehydrated ethyl alcohol made from biomass or raw ethyl alcohol to be used as biofuel; biobutanol – butil alcohol made from biomass used as biofuel or biocomponent; biodiesel fuel (biodiesel) – methyl and/or ethyl esters of higher organic acids obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats that are used as biofuel or biocomponent; biogas – gas obtained from biomass that is used as fuel; biohydrogen – hydrogen obtained from biomass; it is a type of biogas; biofuel producer – a business entity that directly produces biofuel from biomass; additives based on bioethanol – biocomponents of motor fuel obtained by means of synthesis using bioethanol or by mixing bioethanol with organic compounds and fuel obtained from raw hydrocarbons, the content of bioethanol in which fulfils the requirements of regulatory acts and which are categorised as biofuel; liquid fuel from biomass – diesel biofuel, bioethanol, biobutanol, pure oil and other synthetic fuels, made from biomass; synthetic biofuels – synthetic hydrocarbons and mixtures of synthetic hydrocarbons made from biomass. Core principles of state policy in the field of alternative types of fuel The core principles of state policy in the field of alternative types of fuel shall include: promotion of the development and rational use of non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials for the production (extraction) of alternative types of fuel in order to save fuel and energy resources and reduce Ukraine’s dependence on their import; gradual increase in the share of production and use of biofuel and mixed motor fuel determined by standards. The content of bioethanol in motor petrol that is produced and/or is sold within the territory of Ukraine shall be: in 2013 – recommended content of at least 5 per cent (volume); in 2014–2015 – required content of at least 5 per cent (volume); since 2016 – required content of at lest 7 per cent (volume); reduction of the negative impact on the environment by means of using wastes of various activities as raw materials for the production of alternative types of fuel; environmentally responsible production (extraction), transportation, storage and consumption of alternative types of fuel; support for the development of the scientific and technical base for the production (extraction) of alternative types of fuel, promotion of scientific and technical achievements in this field; support of entrepreneurship in the field of alternative types of fuel on the basis of state protection of the entrepreneur’s interests; promotion among the population of economic, environmental, social and other advantages of production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel; development of international, scientific and technical co-operation, increased use of opportunities of the world science and technology in the field of alternative types of fuel; prevention of artificial creation of monopolies in the market of alternative types of fuel, and in the event of recognition of natural monopolies following the procedure established by legislation, implementation of control over their activities, prevention of the monopoly abuse and restraint of monopolism, if the need for such restraint is not established by legislation. Alternative types of liquid fuel Alternative types of liquid fuel shall include: combustible liquids obtained during the processing of solid types of fuel (coal, peat, shale); alcohols (bioethanol, biobutanol) and synthetic products obtained on their basis which can be used as fuel or fuel components (additives based on bioethanol and biobutanol), oils, other types of liquid fuel from biomass (including biodiesel); combustible liquids obtained from industrial wastes, including gas emissions, sewage, effluents and other industrial wastes; fuel obtained from oil and gas condensate from oil, gas and gas condensate deposits of non-industrial use and depleted deposits, from heavy grades of oil and natural bitumen if this fuel does not belong to the traditional type. Technical equipment operating on alternative types of fuel and the procedure for confirming the ability of technical equipment to operate on alternative types of fuel Technical equipment operating on alternative types of fuel includes equipment intended or re-equipped to operate on at least one of types of alternative fuel or on a mixture of traditional fuel with alternative one, where bioethanol content meets the requirements of regulatory acts and which is capable to operate on such fuel without aggravation of safety, reliability and compliance of their environmental indicators with requirements of regulatory acts. Organisational and economic measures to stimulate production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel Organisational and economic measures to stimulate production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel shall include: determination of sources and directions for financing of measures in the field of alternative fuel; the use in the field of alternative types of fuel of economic levers and stimulus stipulated by legislation of Ukraine for enterprises, institutions, organisations and citizens whose activities are related to the development and introduction of low-waste, resource-saving, environmentally friendly technologies when using non-traditional and renewable sources and types of energy, including emissions, and discharges of pollutants into the environment during the production process of alternative types of fuel; providing legal entities and individuals with subsidies, grants, tax, credit and other benefits established by laws of Ukraine to stimulate development and introduction of new technologies, equipment, materials in the production (extraction) process of alternative types of fuel; stimulation of enterprises-manufacturers of machines, mechanisms, devices, energy systems, other technical equipment and appliances to them, working on alternative types of fuel as well as enterprises, institutions, organisations and citizens which re-equip technical equipment working on traditional types of fuel, in order to consume alternative types of fuel; stimulation of investment activities and introduction of new technologies in the field of alternative types of fuel by means of creation of a preferential investment regime and other economic activities by foreign investors; according to law, provision of special state guarantees to protect foreign investment directed to develop the field of alternative types of fuel; creation of special information fund to accumulate, systematise and disseminate information about the presence of non-traditional sources and types of energy raw materials in Ukraine. Offences in the field of alternative types of fuel Offences in the field of alternative type of fuel shall include: sale of alternative types of fuel that does not meet the requirements of regulatory acts by enterprises-manufacturers, legal entities, individuals; production, sale and consumption of traditional types of fuel as alternative ones; granting benefits to producers and consumers of alternative types of fuel, if their activities do not meet the requirements of the legislation on alternative types of fuel; non-execution of orders, instructions of the authorities implementing state supervision and control over observance of the current legislation on alternative types of fuel as well as creating obstacles for their activities; unreasonable refusal to provide relevant authorities with the necessary information about production (extraction) and consumption of alternative types of fuel.
