Establishment of tariffs on cargo, passenger and luggage transportation by the railway transport (except for suburban passenger transportations) within Ukraine is performed on the basis of budget, price and tariff policy according to the procedure determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Tariffs on passenger and luggage transportation in suburban communication are set by the respective railways upon concordance with the local bodies of executive power. If the level of tariffs does not provide profitability of these transportations, losses of railways are covered from the local budgets. Tariffs on cargo, passenger and luggage transportation by the railway transport in international communication are set in accordance with the international agreements and the current legislation of Ukraine. Settlements for works and services, related to cargo, passenger, luggage, mail transportation, as regards to which the state regulation of tariffs is not carried out, are made by free tariffs which are determined upon the agreement between the parties according to the procedure that does not contradict to the legislation on protection of economic competition.
