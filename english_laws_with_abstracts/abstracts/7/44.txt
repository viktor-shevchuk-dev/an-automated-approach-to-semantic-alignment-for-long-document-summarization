Assets of a collective investment institution in form of securities, which are serviced by the depositary system, are booked on the keeperâ€™s securities account. Services in keeping securities of a collective investment institution and accounting for their property rights, as well as servicing the operations of a collective investment institution are provided and carried out according to the legislation. The keeper of a collective investment institute with public placement is a bank that holds a license for security depositary activity, issued by the Commission according to the established procedure. It is not mandatory to conclude an agreement with a keeper to service assets of a collective investment institution with private placement. If a corporate fund or the asset management company of a share fund with private placement concludes such agreement, the keeper of assets for such collective investment institution can be a legal entity holding a license for security depositary activity, issued by the Commission according to the established procedure. Affiliated persons of the asset management company, auditor (audit firm), assessor of property of the collective investment institute, or the depositary, cannot be keeper of assets of a collective investment institution. Each collective investment institution can only have one keeper of assets of a collective investment institution (Article 68 of the Law).
