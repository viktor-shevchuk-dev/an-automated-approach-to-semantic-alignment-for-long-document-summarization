Article 18 of the Law determines the conditions for preventing legalization (laundering) of illegal incomes. While rendering financial services, financial institutions are prohibited from entering any contractual relations with anonymous persons, opening and maintaining anonymous (numbered) accounts. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering contractual relations with clients - legal entities or natural persons - in case there are doubts that the person is really acting on their own behalf.
