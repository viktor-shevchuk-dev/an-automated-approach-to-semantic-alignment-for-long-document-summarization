Parents are obligated to take care of their children's health, physical and spiritual development, and ensure their healthy lifestyle. In case the failure to observe this obligation causes significant harm to the child's health, the persons responsible may be deprived of parental rights according to the established procedure (Article 59 of the Fundamentals).
