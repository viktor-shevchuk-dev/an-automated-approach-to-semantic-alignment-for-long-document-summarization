According to Article 9 of the Law, the application to be granted the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection is reviewed by migration service bodies in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the regions, and the cities of Kyiv and Sevastopol within two months of the decision to process the documents required to resolve the issue of granting the status of a refugee or a person in need of subsidiary protection. This time can be extended by the head of the migration service body based on a motivated request of the employee reviewing the application, but only insofar that the total term of review does not exceed three months.
