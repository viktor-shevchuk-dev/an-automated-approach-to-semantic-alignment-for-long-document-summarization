Water protective zones are set along rivers, seas and around lakes, water reservoirs and other ponds for creation of favorable treatment of water objects, prevention of their pollution, litter and exhaustion, elimination of water plants and animals, as well as reduction of variation of flow. In some cases mining of sand and gravel outside the lands of water fund on a dry part of flood-lands, in old river-beds may be permitted in the water protective zone upon agreement with the state bodies on environmental protection, protection of water economy and geology.
