Procedural decisions are all resolutions of bodies of pre-trial investigation, the prosecutor, investigating magistrate, and the court. A court resolution is made in form of a ruling or a verdict. A decision of an investigator or a prosecutor is made in form of a decree. A decree is made in cases provided for by the Code, as well as when considered necessary by the investigator or the prosecutor. A bill of indictment is a procedural decision by which the prosecutor presents an accusation of a criminal offence, and which concludes pre-trial investigation (Article 110 of the Code).
