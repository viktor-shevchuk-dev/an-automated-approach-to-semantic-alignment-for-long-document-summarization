The jury advisement is presided by the head, who presents, one after another, each of the issues that must be resolved by the court to approve a verdict, conducts an open vote, and counts the votes. All issues are decided by an ordinary majority vote. The head votes last. No member of the jury has the right to abstain from voting, except for cases when the measure of punishment is being decided on, and the judge or the juror had voted to acquit the accused. In this case the vote of the abstaining juror is added to votes given to the option that favors the accused. Any disagreement on which decision is more favorable for the accused is resolved by voting. Any member of the jury may separately present their opinion in writing; this written statement will not be announced in the court session, but is included in the proceedings file and is available for examination (Article 391 of the Code).
