A university, academy, or institute, regardless of its ownership form, can be granted a national status according to the legislation. A national status is granted to a higher educational institution by proposal of the National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance, submitted according of the procedure and criteria established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Conformance of the higher educational institution's activity to the established criteria to confirm or withdraw such status is checked once per 7 years by the National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance (Article 29 of Law).
