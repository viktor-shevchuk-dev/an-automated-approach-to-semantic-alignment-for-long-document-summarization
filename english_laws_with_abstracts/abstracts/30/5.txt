Application of foreign law included all its norms that regulate respective legal relations. Application of a norm of a foreign state shall not be limited only due to the fact that this norm belongs to public law. While determining the applicable law, the court or other body shall be guided by the interpretation of norms and notions according to the law of Ukraine unless otherwise is envisaged by law. If the content of legal norms of a foreign state has not been established in a reasonable time, the law of Ukraine shall apply.
