No one may be coerced to join any civil association. Membership or non-membership in any civil association cannot constitute grounds to limit the rights and freedom of the person, or to receive any privileges or advantages from the bodies of state power, other state bodies, bodies of power of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, or bodies of local self-government. Any person has the right to stop being a member (participant) of a civil association, voluntarily, at any time, and according to the procedure established by its charter. Except in cases determined by law, it is forbidden to require information about a person's membership (participation) in a civil association, unless such requirement is related to the person's exercising their rights as a person entitled to represent the civil association, or as a member (participant) of the civil association (Article 5 of the Law).
