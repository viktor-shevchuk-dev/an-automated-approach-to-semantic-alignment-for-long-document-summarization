13. A convict may appeal against a penalty imposed on them, but filing a complaint shall not terminate the execution of the penalty. The official who imposed the penalty may, for good cause, revoke it or replace it with another, more lenient penalty. A higher official may revoke a penalty where the official who imposed the penalty has exceeded their powers or where the penalty has been imposed in the absence of a violation on the part of the convict.
