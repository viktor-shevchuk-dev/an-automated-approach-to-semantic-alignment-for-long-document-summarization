If the patent owner does not prove that the fact that a variety has not been used or the fact of refusal to grant a licence is due to valid reason, and the plaintiff proves to be financially and in all other respects competent to effectively exercise the rights granted by the licence, the compulsory licence may be granted by a court decision for up to four years.
