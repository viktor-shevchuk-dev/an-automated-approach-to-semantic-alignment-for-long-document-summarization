At the request of a case party or on its own initiative, the court may, prior to the case consideration, separate the claims on the merits, having allocated one or more combined claims to separate proceedings, if this fosters the task of commercial proceedings. Consideration of the claims allocated for independent proceedings shall be carried out by the judge who has made the judgment on separation of claims.
