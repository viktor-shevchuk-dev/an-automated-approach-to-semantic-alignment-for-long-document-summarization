If the value of the cargo loaded does not cover the freight and other expenses of the carrier in respect of the cargo, and the consignor has not paid the full freight before the departure of the vessel and has not provided additional security, the carrier shall be entitled to terminate the contract before the vessel leaves and to demand payment of half of the agreed freight, demurrage charges if any, and other expenses incurred by the carrier in respect of the cargo. The unloading of such cargo shall be for the account of the consignor.
