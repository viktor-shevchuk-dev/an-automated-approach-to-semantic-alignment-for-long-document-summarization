A lawsuit for compensation for oil pollution damage may be brought directly against the insurer or another person who has provided security for the liability of the vessel’s proprietor. The person against whom such a lawsuit is brought shall be entitled to limit their liability under Article 308 of this Code if the proprietor’s liability under Article 350 of this Code cannot be limited. The defendant under such a lawsuit shall be entitled to raise against the claims of the injured party such defences as the proprietor of the vessel themselves might have invoked other than the insolvency of the vessel’s proprietor or the liquidation of their enterprise. The defendant shall also be exempted from liability if they prove that the oil pollution damage is the result of the vessel proprietor’s intentional fault. At the request of the defendant, the proprietor of the vessel shall be held liable as a co-defendant.
