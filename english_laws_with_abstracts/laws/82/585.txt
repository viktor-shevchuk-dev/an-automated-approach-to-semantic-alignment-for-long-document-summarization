If the data referred to in clause 7 of this Article have not been verified in the case of carriage in bulk, the carrier shall be entitled to include them in the bill of lading with an appropriate reservation. The same reservation may be made by the carrier when carrying various cargoes where it has reasonable grounds for believing that the data referred to in clause 7 of this Article have been stated inaccurately by the consignor or where it has no reasonable opportunity to verify them. When cargo is carried in overseas traffic, other conditions and reservations may also be stated in the bill of lading by agreement of the parties.
