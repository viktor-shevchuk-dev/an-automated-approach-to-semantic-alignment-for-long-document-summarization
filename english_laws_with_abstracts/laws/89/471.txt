4. The use of an invention (utility model) for commercial purposes by any person, which acquired a product manufactured using the patented invention (utility model) and could not know that such product has been manufactured or introduced in the turnover with infringement upon rights conferred by the patent, shall not be considered to constitute the infringement upon rights resulting from the state registration. However, upon receipt of an appropriate notice of the holder of rights, the said person shall cease using the product or pay the holder of rights relevant costs, whose amount shall be ascertained according to laws or upon consent of the parties. The disputes related to such payments and the disbursement procedures shall be settled by way of a court procedure.
