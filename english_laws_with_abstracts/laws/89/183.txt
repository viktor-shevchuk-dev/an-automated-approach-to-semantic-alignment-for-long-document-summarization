7. An invention involves an inventive step, if it is not obvious for a specialist, i.e., does not result from the level of technology explicitly. The contents of applications mentioned in Part 5 of this Article shall not be taken into account in the course of the assessment of the inventive step. New forms of drugs known from the level of technology, including salts, esters, ethers, compositions, combinations and other derivatives, polymorphs, metabolites, pure forms, particle sizes, isomers, may be deemed resulting from the level of technology explicitly if they do not differ significantly in efficiency.
