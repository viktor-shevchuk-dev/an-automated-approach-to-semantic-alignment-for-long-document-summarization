12. If in materials of an application which meets requirements of Article 13 of this Law, there is a reference to a drawing, but such a drawing is absent, a notification of this is sent to the applicant with a proposal, on his/her choice, either to send the drawing or to exclude the reference to it in the application. If the drawing is filed within 2 months from the date of receipt of the notification by the applicant, the date of receiving of the drawing by the NIPO is considered the application submission date. If the applicant fails to make the proposed choice within this period, the application is considered non-submitted, and the applicant is notified thereof.
