2. A patent holder shall be obliged to grant a permit (licence) for the use of the invention (utility model) to a holder of a patent granted later, if the latter's invention (utility model) is intended for attaining another objective or has considerable technical and economic advantages but may not be used without infringement on rights of the owner of the patent granted earlier. The permit shall be granted in the scope required to use the invention (utility model) by the holder of the patent granted later. In this case, the holder of the patent granted earlier shall have the right to obtain a licence for using the invention (utility model), which is protected by the patent granted later, on favourable conditions.
