If approved by the public partner, property rights arising from the agreement concluded under the public-private partnership may be the subject of a pledge, unless otherwise established by the agreement concluded under the public-private partnership. The pledge of property rights arising from the agreement concluded under the public-private partnership is possible only if the entire set of rights of a private partner arising from the agreement concluded under the public-private partnership is pledged. In this case, charge for the pledge occurs exclusively by replacing the private partner in accordance with the provisions of the direct agreement.
