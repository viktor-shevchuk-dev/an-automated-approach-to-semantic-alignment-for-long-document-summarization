The State Employment Service informs employees about work in the same or another locality according to their professions, specialities, qualifications, and if they are absent, it selects another job, taking into account individual wishes and social needs. If necessary, a person may be sent, with his consent, for professional retraining or advanced training in accordance with the legislation.
