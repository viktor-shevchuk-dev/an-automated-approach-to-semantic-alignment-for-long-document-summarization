In case the owner or his authorised body found a discrepancy of the employee with the position for which he was hired, or work that he performed, he has the right to dismiss such an employee during the probation period, having warned him about it three days in advance in written form. Termination of an employment contract on these grounds may be appealed by the employee in the manner established for the consideration of labour disputes on dismissal issues.
