If the owner or a body authorised by him or the head in respect of whom the requirement for termination of the employment contract has been submitted does not agree with this requirement, he may appeal the decision of the elected body of the primary trade union organization (trade union representative) in court within two weeks from the date of receipt of the decision. In this case, implementation of the requirement to terminate an employment contract is suspended until court makes a decision.
