Dismissal of employees, elected to the trade union bodies of the enterprise, institution, organisation at the initiative of the owner or his/her authorised body, shall be prohibited for a period of one year after the expiration of the term for which this composition was elected (except for cases of complete liquidation of the enterprise, institution, organisation, identified incompatibility of the employee to the position or work performed due to health conditions that prevent the continuation of such work, or the employee's actions which the law provides for dismissal for). Such guarantees shall not be provided to employees in the event of early termination of their powers in such bodies due to improper performance of their duties, or at their own request, unless it is related to health conditions.
