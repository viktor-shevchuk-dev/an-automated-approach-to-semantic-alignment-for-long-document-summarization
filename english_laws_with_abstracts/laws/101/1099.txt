When delivering a decision on reinstatement, the body considering the labour dispute shall simultaneously decide on the payment of the employee's average earnings during the forced absence or the difference in earnings during the performance of lower-paid work, but not more than for the period of one year. If the application for reinstatement is considered for more than one year, through no fault of the employee, the body reviewing the labour dispute shall make a decision on the payment of average earnings for the entire period of forced absence.
