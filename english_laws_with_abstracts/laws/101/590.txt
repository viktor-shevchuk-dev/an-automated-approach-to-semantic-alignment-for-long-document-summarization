The work of piece-workers is paid at the rates set for the work performed. In those branches of the national economy where, by the nature of production, employees are assigned to perform work rated below the categories conferred to them, employees who perform such work are paid a difference between the categories. Payment of the difference between the categories and the conditions of such payment shall be established by collective agreements.
