Decision of the elected body of the primary trade union organization (trade union representative) to refuse to give consent to terminate the employment contract should be justified. If the decision contains no justification for refusal to grant consent to terminate the employment contract, the owner or his authorized body has the right to dismiss the employee without consent of the elected body of the primary trade union organization (trade union representative).
