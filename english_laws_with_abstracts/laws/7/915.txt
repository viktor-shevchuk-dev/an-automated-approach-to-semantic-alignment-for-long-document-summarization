The Commission shall review the circumstances and grounds for suspension of the placement and redemption of securities of the open or interval collective investment institution within seven working days from the date of receipt of the notice of suspension of placement and redemption of securities of the collective investment institution. Upon review, the Commission may decide that such a suspension is not justified and order the asset management company to renew the placement and redemption of the securities of the collective investment institution.
