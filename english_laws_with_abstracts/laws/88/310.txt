In general secondary, specialised, professional (technical), educational institutions physical culture lessons are compulsory and must be conducted not less than three times a week. Local state administrations and local self-government authorities can make decisions on the introduction of additional physical culture lessons at the general secondary and specialised education institutions, provided there is funding for that in relevant budgets.
