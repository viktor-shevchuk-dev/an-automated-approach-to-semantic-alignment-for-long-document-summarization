2. The arbitration agreement shall be concluded in writing. An agreement is considered to be in writing if it is contained in a document signed by the parties or concluded in an exchange of letters or electronic communication if the information contained therein is accessible to be usable for subsequent reference, messages sent by telex, telegraph or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement, or in an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by another. The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.
