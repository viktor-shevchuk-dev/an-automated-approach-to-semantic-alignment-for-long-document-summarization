This Law is based on the recognition of the value of arbitration (arbitration tribunal) as a widely used method of settling disputes arising in international trade and the need for comprehensive regulation of international commercial arbitration by means of legislation; it takes into account the provisions on such arbitration contained in the international treaties of Ukraine as well as in the model law adopted in 1985 by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and approved by the UN General Assembly for its possible use by the states in their legislation.
