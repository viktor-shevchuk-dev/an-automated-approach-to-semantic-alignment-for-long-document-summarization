1. If an arbitrator becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his or her functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, his or her mandate terminates if he or she withdraws from office or if the parties agree on the termination of the mandate. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the authority specified in Article 6 to decide on the termination of the mandate; such a decision shall be subject to no appeal.
