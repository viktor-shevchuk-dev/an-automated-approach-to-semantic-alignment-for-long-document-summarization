2. An agreement concluded on behalf of an entity represented by a commercial agent, without the authority to conclude it or in excess of the authority granted to it, shall be considered approved by this entity, provided it does not reject the actions of a commercial agent before a third party. Subsequent approval of the agreement by an entity represented by an agent shall make the agreement valid from the date of its conclusion.
