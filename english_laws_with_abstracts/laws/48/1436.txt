3. A guarantor shall have the right to file only those claims to an entitled party, the filing of which is allowed by a letter of guarantee. An obligated party shall have no right to raise objections to a guarantor, which it could raise to an entitled party, if its agreement with a guarantor does not contain an obligation of a guarantor to make a reservation in a letter of guarantee in respect of raising such objections.
