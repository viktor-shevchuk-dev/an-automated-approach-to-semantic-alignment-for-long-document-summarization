Entities intending to produce and/or producing electricity from alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke-oven gases, and only electricity generated by micro, mini and small hydroelectric power plants if hydro energy is used) may not participate in the auctions for distribution of support quotas for those power facilities or stages for their construction (start-up complexes), for which a “green” tariff has been previously established and/or the right to support has been acquired based on the auction results.
