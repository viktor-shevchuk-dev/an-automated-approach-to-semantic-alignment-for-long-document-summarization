1. The subject of the right of legislative initiative is obliged to add the financial and economic substantiation (including the corresponding calculations) to which bill adoption will lead to change of indicators of the budget. If such changes in budget indicators imply a reduction in budget revenues and/or an increase in budget expenses, the draft law shall be supplemented with proposals for changes to legislative acts to reduce budget expenses and/or find additional sources of budget revenues to achieve a balanced budget.
