If the appellate court closes the proceedings by virtue of clause 1 of part 1 of Article 255 of this Code, the court on the plaintiff's application under written proceedings shall decide to transfer the case to the court of the first instance, which has jurisdiction over such a case, except in cases of merging into one proceeding of several claims that are subject to consideration in different proceedings.
