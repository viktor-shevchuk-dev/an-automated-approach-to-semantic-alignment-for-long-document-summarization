3. The application on securing the claim by seizing the assets that are the subject of the dispute in the case of recognition of assets as unfounded and their recovery into the state revenue shall contain sufficient data allowing to consider the assets unfounded, and in the application on securing the claim by seizing other defendants' assets corresponding to the value of the assets that are the subject of the dispute, the justification of the impossibility to seize the disputed assets shall be given. If such an application on securing the claim raises the issue of its consideration without notifying the defendant, it must also provide a proper justification for such a need.
