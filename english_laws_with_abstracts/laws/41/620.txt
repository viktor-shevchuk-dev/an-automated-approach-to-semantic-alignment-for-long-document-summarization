1. If it is impossible to provide evidence independently, a case party shall have the right to file a petition to request for evidence by the court. Such a petition must be filed within the period specified in parts two and three of Article 83 of this Code. If such a petition is filed with a delay, the court shall dismiss it, unless the person filing it justifies the impossibility of filing it within the set period for reasons beyond its control.
