2. After the judgment on declaring a natural person deceased has entered into force, the court shall send the judgment to the state civil registration authority for the registration of an individual as deceased, as well as to the notary at the place of opening of the inheritance; and in the settlement without a notary, the court shall send the judgment to the relevant local government to take measures on protection of the hereditary property. If there are several notaries in the settlement, as well as in cases where the place of opening of the inheritance is unknown, the judgment shall be sent to the state notary archive in order to transfer it to the authorised notary to take measures on protection of the hereditary property.
