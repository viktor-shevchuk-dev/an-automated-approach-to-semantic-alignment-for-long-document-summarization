If a person who filed the application on recognition as a stateless person failed to exercise the right to appeal, a central executive authority enforcing the state policy on migration (immigration and emigration), including the counteraction to irregular (illegal) migration, nationality, registration of individuals, refugees and other categories of migrants determined by the legislation shall seize his/her certificate on the application for recognition as a stateless person, return the original documents submitted along with the application for recognition as a stateless person (if any) and resolves the issue on voluntary or forcible return or forcible deportation.
