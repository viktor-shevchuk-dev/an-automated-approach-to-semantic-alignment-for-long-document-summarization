6. The National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance, within six months after its establishment, shall form and submit for approval to the central executive authority for education and science a unified list of specialities by combining the current list of specialities taught at the institutions of higher education with the current list of specialities available for defending the candidate of science and doctor of science dissertations and obtaining academic degrees and academic titles, based on the latter. In so doing, the current specialities shall be considered specialisations that are developed and approved directly by the institutions of higher education and are not subject to approval by government authorities.
