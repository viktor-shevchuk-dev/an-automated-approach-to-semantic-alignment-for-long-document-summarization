2. A court of cassation shall review judgments of first and appellate instance courts within the scope of the cassation complaint. A court of cassation shall have the right to go beyond the scope of cassation claims unless this may aggravate the position of the convict, the acquitted, or the person in respect of whom applying compulsory medical or reformatory measures was considered. Where granting the complaint gives grounds for taking a decision in favour of other convicts who have not filed complaints, the court of cassation instance shall take such decision.
