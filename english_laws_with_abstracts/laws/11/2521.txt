The defence shall have the right to deny the public prosecutor access to any records, which the public prosecutor may use to prove the guilt of the accused in commission of a criminal offence. A decision as to whether any specific records shall be deemed susceptible of being used by the public prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accused in commission of a criminal offence and, hence, a decision as to granting or not granting the public prosecutor access to such records may be postponed until the defence has finished their examination of the materials of pre-trial investigation.
