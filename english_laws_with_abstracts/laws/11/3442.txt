2. Court of appellate instance shall have the right to go beyond the scope of the appellate demands where the status of the accused or the person in respect to whom the issue has been disposed of applying compulsory medical or reformatory measures, is not aggravated thereby. Where consideration of appellate complaint gives grounds for adoption of a decision in favour of persons in whose interests no appellate complaints have been received, the court of appellate instance shall adopt such decisions.
