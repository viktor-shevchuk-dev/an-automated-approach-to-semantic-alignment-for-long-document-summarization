5. All issues related to the dismissal of jurors from participation in trial, as well as the issues associated with self-recusations and recusations of jurors shall be decided by a ruling of the court composed of two judges, which shall be made after counsel on the spot without retiring to the deliberations room, unless the court deems such retirement necessary. Where the judges do not reach a unanimous decision on the issue related to the dismissal of a juror from the criminal proceedings or the recusal or removal of a juror, a juror shall be deemed dismissed from the criminal proceedings or recused.
