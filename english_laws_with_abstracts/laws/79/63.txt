Clinical trials of medicinal products involving an individual found incompetent by the court or whose civil capacity is limited due to a mental illness may be conducted only in cases where the medicinal product is intended for the mental treatment, provided that there is a scientific substantiation of the benefits of the possible success of these studies over the risk of causing grave consequences for the health or life of such an individual, with the written consent of his guardians.
