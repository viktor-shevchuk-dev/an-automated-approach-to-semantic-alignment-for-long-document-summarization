This type of raw material belongs to Category D. The resource potential of tantalum and niobium in Ukraine is the highest in Europe. Currently, the extraction of tantalum-niobium raw materials in Ukraine is not carried out. Production facilities for the production of finished products are not practically used due to the reduction in concentrate production in Russia. Ukraine can fully meet its own needs for tantalum-niobium raw materials. Within the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, two large rare metal distribution areas of tantalum and niobium are distinguished: the Pryazovia and North-Western regions.
