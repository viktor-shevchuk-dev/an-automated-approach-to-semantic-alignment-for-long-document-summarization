continuation of engineering and geological works to identify and assess the development of dangerous geological processes, primarily flooding, as a process that has regional development and contributes to the activation of other dangerous exogenous geological processes (landslides, subsidence of the Earth's surface, karst erosion and suffosion, etc.) and causes an increase in seismic safety;
