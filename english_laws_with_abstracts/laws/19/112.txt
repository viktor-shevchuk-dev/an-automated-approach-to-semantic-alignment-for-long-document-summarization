Reserves structure and the technology of processing manganese ores cannot meet the growing needs of ferrous metallurgy for manganese concentrates (primarily low-phosphorous) of the highest grades. An important factor is the chemical industry provision with so-called high-quality peroxide concentrates previously imported from Georgia. Readiness for the industrial development of Fedorivske Manganese Ore Deposit, located near Nikopol Basin is one way to solve the problematic issues of the manganese mining complex. The deposit's ores contain 98 per cent of oxidizing and carbonate-oxidizing varieties. They are favourable for enrichment to produce a high-quality concentrate (manganese content up to 49 per cent) and suitable for metallic manganese smelting.
