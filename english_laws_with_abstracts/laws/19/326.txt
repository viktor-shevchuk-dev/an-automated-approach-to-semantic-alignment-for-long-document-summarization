In Ukraine, the study of serpentinite massifs was one-sided. First of all, the serpentinite residual soil for silicate nickel ores was studied on the massifs, nickel sulfide and chromite ores were searched, but due to the specifics of the work and insufficient funding, comprehensive studies of serpentinites were not conducted. At the same time, it was found that serpentinites are primarily high-quality magnesium ores both for the extraction of metallic magnesium (MgO – 97–98.8 per cent), suitable for the manufacture of high-quality periclase refractories, and magnesium oxide (magnesia).
