Imports from Russia provide Ukraine's needs for lithium products (approximately 100-200 tons per year in terms of metal). Zavitinskoye deposit, the only lithium ore deposit in Transbaikalia, is almost already produced, and Russia itself imports lithium products. It is predicted that the demand for petalite concentrate for the production of special glass and special ceramics will increase to several tens of thousands of tons. The prospects for creating our own lithium mineral resource base in Ukraine and turning the country from an importer to an exporter of lithium products are quite high. They are related to the real possibility of developing Polokhivka petalite ore deposit and Shevchenkove spodumene deposit, which requires additional exploration to identify profitable ores of industrial categories. The development of other fields of rare metal pegmatites can lead to the discovery of new promising deposits for development.
