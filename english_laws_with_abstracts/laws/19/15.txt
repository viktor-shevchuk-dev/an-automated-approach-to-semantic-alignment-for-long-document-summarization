The mineral resource complex provides a significant share of the gross national product. 48 per cent of the country's industrial potential and up to 20 per cent of its labour resources are associated with the extraction and use of minerals. These figures are close to those of developed countries with a strong mining industry, where 20 to 40 per cent of total investment and up to 20 per cent of labour resources are concentrated.
