Arable land in Ukraine is 27.5 million hectares. Every year after harvesting, the soil loses approximately 1 million tons of active substance in terms of P2O5 (phosphorus pentoxide). It is necessary to introduce fertilizers in the amount of 60 kilograms per hectare every year in terms of phosphorus pentoxide (digestible) to replenish it. In fact, over the past 2â€“3 years, less than 10 kilograms per hectare were introduced in terms of phosphorus pentoxide.
