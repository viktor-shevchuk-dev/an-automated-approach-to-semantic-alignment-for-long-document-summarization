In Ukraine, deposits of quartz-glauconite sands of Neogene and Cretaceous age are widely distributed on the territory of the Volyn-Podillia Plate, the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and in the south-eastern part of the Dnipro-Donets Rift. Their forecast resources are approximately 5 billion tons. There are no proven glauconite deposits in Ukraine, but quartz-glauconite sands with a glauconite content of up to 40-60 per cent are common in some regions.
