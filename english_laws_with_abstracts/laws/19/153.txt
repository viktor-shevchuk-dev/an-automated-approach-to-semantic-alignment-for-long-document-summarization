Prospects for the sulfide nickel content of Ukraine are limited, but there are some prerequisites for discovering industrial deposits of nickel sulfide. The green-stone belts and arrays of ultrabasites of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield are the non-traditional sources of nickel-cobalt ores for Ukraine. There is a fairly high probability of discovering industrial facilities of the West Australian type (in komatiites) and associated with stratified dunite and peridotite intrusions.
