This type of raw material belongs to Category D. On the territory of Ukraine, feldspar rocks of the Archean-Proterozoic are widely developed within the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. Pegmatites of 33 localisation fields tend to be massifs of granites of various complexes, where they form clusters of mainly vein bodies with an average thickness of 3-8 meters, often of differentiated structure. The block and pegmatite zones of these veins are of industrial interest as feldspar raw materials.
