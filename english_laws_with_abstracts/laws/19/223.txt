This type of raw material belongs to Category C. Fifteen lanthanides and yttrium, close to them, make up a group of rare earths or rare earth metals, the demand for which is constantly growing. It is estimated that Ukraine's needs for rare earths today amount to hundreds of tons. The Prydniprovia Chemical Plant previously produced 1,500 tons of rare earths products per year. Loparite concentrate was the raw material, the production of which is now being stopped in Russia. Ukraine has industrial facilities and technologies to produce high-purity rare earth metals and their compounds and alloys widely used. The development of its own mineral resource base of rare-earth metals, without which it is impossible to produce high-quality, competitive steels and alloys, has become an urgent need.
