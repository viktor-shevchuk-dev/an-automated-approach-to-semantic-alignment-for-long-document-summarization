Prospects for discovering additional sources of these metals are associated with green-stone complexes on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, where galenite-sphalerite ores as part of separate mineralisation zones of such gold deposits as Balka Shyroka were found. The lack of spatial parameterisation of ore zones of this type remains the main problem.
