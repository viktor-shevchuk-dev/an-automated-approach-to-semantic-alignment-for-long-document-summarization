Lead-zinc ores of fairly high quality are known in two regions of Ukraine: Transcarpathia and the south-eastern part of the Dnipro-Donets Rift. Prospects for lead and zinc extraction are associated with gold and polymetallic deposits in Transcarpathia. The operation of Muzhievo gold and polymetallic deposit can only partially meet the needs of Ukraine.
