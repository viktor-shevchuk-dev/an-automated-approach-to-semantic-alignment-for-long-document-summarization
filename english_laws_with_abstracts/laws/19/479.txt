The upper part of the rocks of the Earth's crust on 80 per cent of the territory of Ukraine is disturbed by the impact of mining, industrial and urban development, land reclamation, hydraulic engineering construction, which caused pollution of underground water resources, the development and activation of dangerous exogenous geological processes (landslides, subsidence, flooding, karst processes, etc.) and increased seismicity. Negative consequences of the closure of mining enterprises, mines and open-pit mines significantly complicated the ecological and geological problems of many regions.
