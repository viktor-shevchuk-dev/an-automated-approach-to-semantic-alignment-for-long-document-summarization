The annual growth of their reserves for up to 2030 is 2 per cent due to the available hydrocarbon resources. When determining the cost of a unit of inventory preparation, the average of UAH 30.9 achieved for 2004–2009 was adopted. The planned increase in reserves requires expenditures (considering the Consumer Price Index): in 2011–2020 – 72,032.35 million UAH (including 5,460.03 million UAH from the state budget), in 2021–2030 – 104,225.73 million UAH, respectively (including 7,863.19 million UAH from the state budget). The share of the state budget in the total financing of search and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits is 8 per cent (the level of ratios achieved over the past 10 years).
