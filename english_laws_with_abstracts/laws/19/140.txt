Ukraine does not have industrial reserves of copper ores, despite the total rather significant projected resources. They are connected to three regions: Donetsk and Volyn-Podillia metallogenic copper ore provinces and the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. In the latter's territory, in the trap formation of the Volyn ore region was discovered native copper mineralisation. Rafalivka and Hirnytskyi ore nodes have already been identified as the most promising in this territory. In total, there are more than 150 copper ore occurrences on the territory of Ukraine. Some of them can be considered as potential deposits.
