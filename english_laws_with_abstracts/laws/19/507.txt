The environmental seismic situation in the regions with a large number of mineral deposits and forecast resources of mineral raw materials, particularly hydrocarbons, concentrated on the Black and Azov seas shelf, requires proper consideration and assessment of risks associated with seismic phenomena. To ensure the functioning of a single network of hydrogen deformational monitoring and variations of geophysical fields, necessary for the implementation of a long-and medium-term forecast of the geodynamic state of the territory of Ukraine, the creation of a hydrogen deformational bank and other geophysical data to assess the risk of geodynamic events, improving the safety of industrial enterprises, including mining, and the population living in earthquake-prone regions, for the period up to 2030 in this direction the following is provided:
