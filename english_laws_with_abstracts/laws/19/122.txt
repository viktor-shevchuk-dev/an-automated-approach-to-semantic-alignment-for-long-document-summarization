This type of raw material belongs to Category D. Ukraine does not yet have its own mineral resource base for chromium, the demand for which is 300-330 thousand tons per year (in terms of 100 per cent of Cr2 O3). Ukraine may reduce the import of chromium concentrates from Kazakhstan and Russia (from Don and Saransk Mining and Processing Plants) in the coming years due to the exploration and commissioning of Kapitanivka chromite deposit on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. The operation of this deposit will partially meet the needs of the domestic metallurgical industry through its own extraction of chromium and chromium-nickel raw materials. The ores of Kapitanivka deposit and other promising sites of the Pobuzhzhia need further research for industrial concentrations of gold, platinoids and metallic rhenium.
