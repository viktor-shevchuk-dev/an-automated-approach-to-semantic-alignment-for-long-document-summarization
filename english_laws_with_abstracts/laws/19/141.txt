It is also necessary to consider the significant prospects for detecting copper ores as a component of specific copper-zinc-pyrite mineralisation of green-stone rock complexes of ancient shields (primarily the Ukrainian Crystal Shield) with the copper content of classical world deposits of this type at the level of 3-4 per cent and zinc at the level of 8-10 per cent (with a low lead content). The development zones of chalcopyrite as part of the gold-productive polysulfide mineral complex of gold deposits such as Serhiivka deposit can be another important source of copper extraction.
