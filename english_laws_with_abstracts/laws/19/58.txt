As of 1 January 2010, the initial total resources of the Western region amount to 1,464.2 million tons of conventional fuel, including 988.2 billion cubic meters of gas and 476.0 million tons of oil and condensate. The degree of realisation of the initial total hydrocarbon resources is 41.8 per cent. The undiscovered (residual) part is 867.4 conventional units. The current amount of forecast and prospective oil and gas resources, which can be a priority basis for discovering new deposits and the growth of hydrocarbon reserves, is 2603.0 million tons of oil and 157.7 billion cubic meters of free gas. The Western region also has significant prospects for increasing hydrocarbon reserves and their extraction.
