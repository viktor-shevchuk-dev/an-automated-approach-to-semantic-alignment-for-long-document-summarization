This type of raw material belongs to Category C. Existing mining enterprises are fully provided with reserves of flux raw materials, but the vast majority of these reserves are suitable only for obsolete blast furnace and open-hearth steel production. Converter and electric steel production require the same raw materials but of high quality (chemical composition and mechanical strength).
