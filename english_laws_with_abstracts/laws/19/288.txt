For more than a century of the history of Ukrainian metallurgy, an influential industry for the extraction and primary processing of non-metallic raw materials has been created. Of all the types of these raw materials (limestones, dolomites, quartzites, refractory clays, alkaline earth bentonites), Ukraine until recently fully met its own needs and, to a certain extent, the metallurgical needs of Russia, Georgia, and partly Poland and Slovakia. But even now, there are acute problems caused by the general progress in metallurgy and a significant increase in the quality requirements of non-metallic raw materials. Some types of non-metallic raw materials (magnesite, hydrofluoric spar, alkaline bentonites) are imported for the metallurgical industry of Ukraine.
