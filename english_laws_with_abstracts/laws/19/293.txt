The state balance of mineral reserves considers two deposits of fluorspar – the Bakhtyn deposit in the Prydnistrovia with reserves amounted to 18 million tons and Pokrovsk-Kyriivka in the Pryazovia region and two deposits with the content of concomitant fluorine in apatite – Stremyhorod and Novopoltavka deposits. All four fields are not in operation due to the lack of significant capital investment for their development. Bakhtyn fluorite deposit in the Prydnistrovia has been explored and prepared for pilot operation.
