In natural conditions, shale gas is highly dispersed, the gas saturation of rocks reaches from tenths to several per cent, the thickness of productive layers varies in significant volumes up to hundreds of meters with a depth of up to 3000 meters or more and belongs to hard-to-extract minerals. Shale gas deposits are associated with shale (mudslides) of oil and gas basins, including the Central Basin type and oil shale deposits of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, the Volyn-Podillia and the Black Sea region.
