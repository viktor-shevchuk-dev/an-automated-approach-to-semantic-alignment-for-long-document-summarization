As of today, there are no proven reserves of platinum group metals in Ukraine. There are quite high overall prospects for platinum-bearing properties of various geological formations. Now we can speak about platinum group metals resources associated with ore formations of native copper in the traprocks of the Volyn and sulfide copper-nickel ores in the base-ultrabasite massifs of the north-west of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield and chromite-bearing massifs of hyperbazites of the Middle Pobuzhzhia (Holovanivka suture zone).
