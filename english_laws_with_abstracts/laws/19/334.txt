This type of raw material belongs to Category D. The state balance of mineral reserves considers the reserves of disten-sillimanite as a concomitant component in the sands of Malyshevskyi placer titanium-zirconium deposit, which is being developed by Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine, and Vovchansk zircon-rutile-ilmenite deposit. Indigenous deposits of andalusite-disten-sillimanite quartzites and gneiss tend towards Precambrian metamorphic strata of the Ukrainian Crystal Shield. Promising areas for identifying deposits of this raw material are the Pryazovia region and the northern part of Zhytomyr oblast (Sushchany-Perzhansk zone). Currently, Ukraine's annual demand for disten-sillimanite concentrates is 400 thousand tons, and it will increase in the future.
