This type of raw material belongs to Category B. Ukraine has long been one of the world leaders in the native sulfur production. At the same time, the main volume of sulfur was extracted by open-pit mining. Quarry production of sulfur has led to irreversible environmental consequences. The transition to a more progressive method of underground sulfur smelting has led to a sharp reduction in sulfur production (70â€“80 thousand tons), which is significantly lower than the needs of Ukraine. Ukraine's annual demand for native sulfur to produce 98% sulfuric acid (with a total production capacity of 6 million tons) is 2 million tons.
