3. In case of state registration of changes in the information in the United State Register on the expulsion or withdrawal of a member (heir or legal successor) of limited liability or additional liability company, as well as related to the transfer (acquisition) of membership interest (part of the membership interest) in the charter capital to a limited liability or additional liability company itself, a state registrar shall simultaneously make an entry on reduction of the amount of the charter capital by the amount of membership interest (part of the membership interest) in the charter capital. This part shall not apply if a limited liability or additional liability company acquiring membership interest (part of the membership interest) in its charter capital, along with the application for state registration, submits a certificate on the formation of reserve capital in the amount which allows holding membership interest (part of the membership interest) in its charter capital under the law.
