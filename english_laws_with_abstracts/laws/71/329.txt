2. The competent authority shall carry out state registration of facilities by entering the relevant information into the register free of charge. An individual registration number shall be assigned to facilities in the register. A change in the name of a facility operator due to a change in the type of joint-stock company or due to the transformation of a joint-stock company into another economic entity shall not be the ground for the operator to apply to the competent authority for making changes to the facility register with regard to the name of such operator and shall not be the ground for introducing such changes to the register. If the operator the name of which has been changed applies to the competent authority with a written request to make changes to the register with regard to the new name of such operator, the competent authority shall make such changes to the register free of charge and notify the operator thereof in writing.
